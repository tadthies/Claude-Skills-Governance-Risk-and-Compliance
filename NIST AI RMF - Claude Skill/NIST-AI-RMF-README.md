# NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF) Skill for Claude

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This skill provides informational guidance based on NIST AI 100-1 (January 2023) and the accompanying AI RMF Playbook. The AI RMF is a voluntary, non-prescriptive framework. It does not constitute legal advice and does not substitute for compliance obligations under applicable AI regulations such as the EU AI Act. For high-stakes AI deployments affecting fundamental rights, safety systems, or regulated sectors, consult qualified legal counsel and domain experts.

## 1. What Does the Skill Do?

The NIST AI RMF Skill transforms Claude into an expert AI risk management advisor with comprehensive knowledge of the NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF 1.0), published January 2023 as NIST AI 100-1. The framework provides a structured, outcome-based approach to identifying, assessing, and managing AI risks throughout the complete AI lifecycle — from design and development through deployment, monitoring, and decommissioning.

The skill covers all four core functions of the AI RMF: GOVERN (6 categories, 21 subcategories), MAP (5 categories), MEASURE (4 categories), and MANAGE (4 categories) — a total of 19 categories. Every response cites the specific function and category (for example, "GOVERN 1.1" or "MAP 3.2") rather than function names alone. The skill also covers the AI RMF Playbook's suggested actions for each category, enabling organisations to move directly from framework understanding to practical implementation steps.

A central feature of the skill is the seven trustworthiness properties defined by the AI RMF: Accountable and Transparent, Explainable and Interpretable, Fair and Bias-Managed, Privacy-Enhanced, Reliable, Resilient, Safe, Secure and Cyber-Resilient, and Valid and Verified. The skill applies these properties as evaluation lenses when assessing specific AI systems, building risk registers, or determining which categories of the framework to prioritise.

The skill supports AI risk profile construction — building both Current Profile (where the organisation is today) and Target Profile (where it needs to be), with gap analysis and a prioritised remediation roadmap. It also covers AI risk register design, AI incident response planning (aligned to MANAGE 3.x), and cross-framework alignment to the EU AI Act, ISO 42001:2023, and NIST CSF 2.0. The framework's voluntary and non-prescriptive nature is respected throughout: the skill provides structured guidance without implying a single mandatory implementation path.

### Triggering the Skill

The skill activates automatically when you raise NIST AI RMF or AI risk management topics. No special commands are needed. Example natural-language phrases that trigger the skill:

- *"We need to implement the NIST AI RMF"*
- *"AI risk management framework"*
- *"GOVERN function AI"*
- *"AI trustworthiness assessment"*
- *"How do we manage bias in our AI system?"*
- *"AI incident response"*
- *"Map AI RMF to EU AI Act"*
- *"Build an AI risk register"*
- *"AI risk profile"*

### Example Prompts

```
We are a financial services firm planning to deploy an AI model to automate loan
decisions. Conduct a full AI RMF gap assessment across GOVERN, MAP, MEASURE, and
MANAGE functions. For each of the 19 categories, rate our starting position as
Not Started and provide the top 3 suggested actions we should take first.
```

```
Our AI team has built a hiring algorithm that screens CVs. Walk me through the MAP
function context establishment, identify which trustworthiness properties are most
at risk for this use case, and recommend specific MEASURE metrics we should track
for fairness and bias.
```

```
Draft an organisational AI Risk Management Policy covering all six GOVERN categories.
The policy should define our AI risk tolerance, assign accountability structures,
establish cross-functional team obligations, and reference applicable regulations
including the EU AI Act.
```

```
We detected that our customer churn prediction model has significantly degraded
in accuracy after a data pipeline change. Walk me through the MANAGE 3.x incident
response workflow: trigger conditions, containment, stakeholder notification,
remediation steps, documentation, and how to update our risk register.
```

```
Build an AI risk register for our three AI systems: (1) a product recommendation
engine, (2) a fraud detection model, and (3) an automated contract review tool.
For each system, identify the top AI risks, map them to trustworthiness properties,
and assign likelihood, impact, and treatment actions.
```
