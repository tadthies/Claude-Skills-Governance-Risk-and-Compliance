## 1. What Does the Skill Do?

This skill gives Claude deep expertise in India's **Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023**
(DPDPA) — passed by Parliament on 11 August 2023 — and the **Digital Personal Data Protection
Rules, 2025**, notified by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) on
13 November 2025. The full compliance deadline is **13 May 2027** (18 months from Rules
notification), with the Data Protection Board of India (DPBI) operational from November 2025.

The skill covers every chapter of the Act and all 23 Rules: the two-lawful-basis framework
(consent under Section 6 and the eight enumerated Legitimate Uses under Section 7), Data
Fiduciary obligations across Sections 4–10 (notice requirements, security safeguards, breach
notification, data erasure, and children's data protections), Data Principal rights under
Sections 11–15, cross-border transfer rules under Section 16, Significant Data Fiduciary (SDF)
additional obligations under Section 10 and Rule 13, and the Data Protection Board's adjudicatory
powers and the full penalty schedule under Section 33.

The skill uses precise DPDPA terminology throughout — Data Fiduciary, Data Principal, Data
Processor, Significant Data Fiduciary, Data Protection Board — mapping these to GDPR equivalents
once when useful, then maintaining DPDPA language. Every obligation is cited to its governing
Section or Rule (e.g., "Notice must be provided per Section 5 and Rule 3 of the DPDP Rules 2025").
Items pending Central Government notification — including SDF designations, restricted countries
list under Section 16, startup exemptions, and prescribed response timelines — are always flagged
as provisional.

The skill is equally valuable for Indian organisations building compliance programmes and for
global companies that process personal data of individuals located in India, which triggers
extra-territorial application under Section 3. It produces structured gap analysis tables,
standalone notice drafts meeting all Rule 3 requirements, Data Processing Agreement reviews
against Rule 16, breach notification step-by-step procedures against the 72-hour Board timeline,
SDF self-assessment checklists, GDPR vs DPDPA side-by-side comparisons, and children's data
compliance reviews under Section 9 and Rules 10 and 12.
