# California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA/CPRA) Skill for Claude

> **Disclaimer:** This skill provides informational guidance based on the text of the California Consumer Privacy Act (Cal. Civ. Code §1798.100 et seq.) and the California Privacy Rights Act (Proposition 24), together with CPPA regulations and published enforcement guidance. It does not constitute legal advice. For matters involving significant compliance risk, CPPA investigation response, class action exposure, or complex data-sharing arrangements, consult a qualified privacy attorney licensed in California.

## 1. What Does the Skill Do?

This skill turns Claude into an expert advisor on California's comprehensive privacy law framework — covering both the **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**, effective January 1, 2020, and the **California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA)**, effective January 1, 2023. The CPRA substantially amended and expanded CCPA, created the independent California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA), and introduced new rights and obligations that this skill fully covers.

The skill handles the full breadth of CCPA/CPRA compliance work: determining whether a business meets the statutory thresholds, guiding the design of consumer rights workflows, drafting privacy notices and opt-out mechanisms, classifying data recipients (service providers, contractors, and third parties), advising on Sensitive Personal Information (SPI) handling, and assessing penalty exposure under the CPPA enforcement regime.

A key strength of the skill is its coverage of the **CPRA additions** — the right to correct, the right to limit SPI use, data minimization and purpose limitation obligations, retention disclosure requirements, contractor classification, and mandatory cybersecurity audit and risk assessment obligations. These CPRA-era changes are where many businesses still have significant gaps, particularly those that completed their initial CCPA compliance work before 2023.

**As of January 1, 2026**, two major CPRA regulatory programs went live:

- **Cybersecurity Audits**: Businesses processing PI presenting significant consumer security risk must conduct annual cybersecurity audits. Regulations finalized in 2025 are now in effect.
- **Risk Assessments**: Businesses must conduct and document risk assessments before processing high-risk PI. The CPPA may request submission of these assessments at any time.

**Also effective January 1, 2026**: The CPPA finalized its **Automated Decision-Making Technology (ADMT)** regulations. Consumers now have the right to opt out of ADMT producing significant decisions, access information about automated processing, and request human review. Businesses must implement ADMT opt-out mechanisms **by January 1, 2027**.

The skill also incorporates **2026 CPPA enforcement precedents** — including the record-breaking $2.75M Disney fine, the $1.1M PlayOn Sports action, and the $375K Ford Motor settlement — to help users understand the current enforcement posture and calibrate their own penalty exposure.

The skill also provides a **CCPA/GDPR comparative analysis**, enabling global privacy teams to map existing EU compliance controls to California requirements and identify US-specific gaps — avoiding duplicate work while catching the material differences (such as the opt-out model vs. the opt-in model for consent, or the private right of action for data breaches).

### Example Prompts

```
"We're a B2C e-commerce company with $30M revenue and 120,000 California 
customers. Run a CCPA/CPRA gap assessment against our current practices: 
we have a privacy policy, no 'Do Not Sell' link, and we use Google Analytics 
and Facebook Pixel."
```

```
"Draft a CCPA-compliant at-collection privacy notice for our mobile app 
sign-up screen. We collect: name, email, phone, precise location, and 
browsing history within the app. We share data with advertising partners."
```

```
"A California consumer submitted a Right to Delete request through our 
website 30 days ago and we haven't responded. Walk me through what we 
must do now, what exceptions might apply, and what our penalty exposure is."
```

```
"We're a European company with GDPR compliance already in place. Produce 
a side-by-side gap analysis showing what additional steps we need to take 
for CCPA/CPRA compliance."
```

```
"Our website uses cookies for cross-context behavioral advertising via 
a third-party DSP. Does this constitute 'sharing' under CPRA? Do we 
need a 'Do Not Sell or Share' link? Must we honor GPC signals?"
```

```
"We use automated scoring to approve or deny insurance applications. 
The CPPA's ADMT rules are now live. What must we implement, and what 
is our deadline for the consumer opt-out mechanism?"
