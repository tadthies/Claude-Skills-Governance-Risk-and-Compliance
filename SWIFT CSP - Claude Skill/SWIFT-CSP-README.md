# SWIFT Customer Security Programme (CSP) Skill for Claude

> **Disclaimer:** This skill provides educational and advisory guidance based on publicly available SWIFT Customer Security Controls Framework (CSCF) documentation. It is not a substitute for an independent assessment conducted by a qualified SWIFT CSP assessor. Attestation decisions must be made by your organisation and its approved independent assessor. SWIFT CSP requirements are subject to annual revision — always verify against the current CSCF version published by SWIFT.

## 1. What Does the Skill Do?

This skill turns Claude into an expert advisor on the **SWIFT Customer Security Programme (CSP)** and the **Customer Security Controls Framework (CSCF) v2026**. It provides structured, actionable guidance to financial institutions, custodians, brokers, corporates, and service bureaux that must achieve and maintain mandatory compliance with SWIFT's security controls across the global payment network.

The skill is grounded in **CSCF v2026** (effective July 2026), which defines 31 security controls — **24 mandatory and 7 advisory** — organised across three objectives: Secure Your Environment, Know and Limit Access, and Detect and Respond. The most significant change in v2026 is that **Control 2.4 (Back-Office Data Flow Security) has been promoted from Advisory to Mandatory**, meaning institutions with back-office connections to SWIFT that previously opted out must now implement this control before their 2026 attestation.

The skill covers all five SWIFT connectivity architecture types (A1, A2, A3, A4, B), enabling precise scoping of which controls are mandatory or advisory for a given institution's infrastructure footprint. Rather than generic cybersecurity advice, the skill produces control-specific output keyed to CSCF control numbers: gap assessments with per-control evidence requirements, architecture scoping matrices, KYC-SA attestation preparation checklists, implementation guidance with concrete evidence artifacts, incident response procedures aligned to SWIFT notification obligations, and cross-framework mappings to ISO 27001:2022, PCI DSS v4.0.1, and NIST CSF 2.0.

The skill covers the annual attestation lifecycle — from independent assessment through KYC Security Attestation (KYC-SA) portal submission. The **v2026 attestation window is July 1 – December 31, 2026**.

## 3. Common Use Cases

### Gap Analysis and Attestation Readiness

- Assess our SWIFT environment against all 24 mandatory CSCF v2026 controls for an A1 architecture
- Produce a gap report with red/amber/green status, evidence availability, and remediation actions
- What changed between CSCF v2025 and v2026 and how does it affect our current attestation?
- We're submitting our KYC-SA before December 31 — give me a pre-submission checklist
- We skipped Control 2.4 in prior years because it was advisory — what do we need to implement now?

### Architecture Scoping

- We use Alliance Access on-premises — which controls apply to us and which are not applicable?
- We switched from a service bureau to a direct A1 connection — how does our control scope change?
- Map all 31 controls to each architecture type (A1/A2/A3/A4/B) in a single reference table
- Our cloud team wants to move SWIFT connectivity to the SWIFT Cloud (A4) — what new controls apply?

### Control Deep-Dives and Implementation

- Walk me through implementing Control 2.4 Back-Office Data Flow Security — what exactly does mandatory mean and what evidence do we need?
- Walk me through implementing Control 4.2 Multi-Factor Authentication — what hardware token options satisfy CSCF v2026?
- What does Control 1.1 require for our SWIFT Secure Zone network architecture? Give me the evidence artifacts
- We're failing Control 6.4 Log and Monitoring — what log sources must feed our SIEM and what is the retention requirement?
- How do we comply with Control 2.8 if our SWIFT messaging is operated by a service bureau?

### KYC-SA Attestation Preparation

- Generate a KYC-SA attestation checklist for all 24 mandatory controls with evidence pointers
- Walk me through the independent assessment requirements for CSCF v2026 — who qualifies as an assessor?
- What does "Partially Implemented" mean in the KYC-SA portal and when should we use it?
- Our counterparty is asking about our attestation status — what do they see on the KYC Registry?

### Incident Response and SWIFT Notifications

- Draft a SWIFT-specific Incident Response Plan covering detection, containment, and SWIFT notification
- At what point does an incident become notifiable to SWIFT and what is the timeline?
- Walk me through the SWIFT incident notification obligations under Control 7.1
- A malware alert was triggered on a SWIFT operator workstation — what do we do in the next 24 hours?

### Cross-Framework Mapping

- Map CSCF v2026 mandatory controls to ISO 27001:2022 Annex A controls
- How does SWIFT CSP relate to PCI DSS v4.0.1 — what gaps remain if we're already PCI-compliant?
- Show me CSCF controls mapped to NIST CSF 2.0 functions and categories
- Does ISO 27001 certification cover our SWIFT CSP obligations?

## 4. How to Use the Skill

### Installation

1. Download the `swift-csp.skill` file from the `SWIFT CSP - Claude Skill/` folder
2. In Claude, go to **Settings → Skills**
3. Upload the `.skill` file
4. The skill activates automatically for relevant conversations — no special command needed

### Triggering the Skill

The skill triggers automatically when your message relates to SWIFT security, CSCF controls, or SWIFT attestation. Example phrases that activate it:

- *"We need to complete our SWIFT CSP attestation by December"*
- *"What does CSCF v2026 require for Control 2.4?"*
- *"Our SWIFT audit found gaps in Control 6.4 — how do we remediate?"*
- *"We use a service bureau for SWIFT — what are our obligations?"*
- *"Map our SWIFT controls to ISO 27001"*
- *"Help us prepare our KYC-SA submission"*
- *"What changed from CSCF v2025 to v2026?"*
- *"Control 2.4 is now mandatory — how do we implement back-office data flow security?"*

### Example Prompts

```
"Run a CSCF v2026 gap assessment for our A1 architecture. We have 
hardware MFA tokens for SWIFT operators, a dedicated SWIFT VLAN with 
firewall rules, SIEM coverage, but our back-office connections to our 
payment hub are not encrypted (we skipped Control 2.4 when it was 
advisory), and we have no SWIFT-specific incident response plan."
```

```
"We are a Type B user (service bureau). Which of the 24 mandatory 
controls do we attest to ourselves versus relying on our bureau's 
attestation? Produce a responsibility assignment table."
```

```
"Draft a SWIFT-specific Incident Response Plan section covering: 
detection triggers, internal escalation, SWIFT notification obligations 
(24-hour and 30-day reporting), evidence preservation, and recovery steps."
```

```
"Produce a KYC-SA attestation preparation checklist for all 24 mandatory 
CSCF v2026 controls. For each control, list: the attestation status options, 
minimum evidence required, and common findings that result in 'Partially 
Implemented' attestation."
```

```
"Map all CSCF v2026 mandatory controls to ISO 27001:2022 Annex A. 
Highlight any SWIFT-specific requirements that are not covered by ISO 27001 
and would require additional controls beyond our ISMS."
```
