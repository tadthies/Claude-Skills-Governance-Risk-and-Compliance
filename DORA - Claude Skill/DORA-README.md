# Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) Skill for Claude

> **Disclaimer:** This skill provides informational guidance on DORA obligations based on Regulation (EU) 2022/2554 and adopted RTS/ITS issued by EBA, ESMA, and EIOPA. It does not constitute legal advice. DORA compliance involves significant obligations under EU financial services law — for matters involving competent authority interaction, major incident reporting, TLPT scoping, or Register of Information submission, consult a qualified DORA compliance professional or your legal counsel.

## 1. What Does the Skill Do?

This skill turns Claude into an expert **DORA compliance advisor** for EU financial entities and their ICT third-party service providers. It covers the full text of **Regulation (EU) 2022/2554** — the Digital Operational Resilience Act — which has applied since **17 January 2025**, along with all adopted **Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS)** and **Implementing Technical Standards (ITS)** issued by EBA, ESMA, and EIOPA (the European Supervisory Authorities).

DORA is structured across 9 chapters covering five substantive compliance areas: the **ICT risk management framework** (Chapter II, Art. 5–16), **ICT-related incident management, classification, and reporting** (Chapter III, Art. 17–23), **digital operational resilience testing** (Chapter IV, Art. 24–27), **ICT third-party risk management** (Chapter V, Art. 28–44), and **information-sharing arrangements** (Chapter VI, Art. 45). The skill provides article-level guidance across all chapters, with particular depth in the areas where compliance gaps are most commonly found.

A defining feature of this skill is its precision in distinguishing between DORA's chapters, frameworks, and the specific adopted RTS/ITS that implement each obligation. The skill always cites the correct Commission Delegated/Implementing Regulation number (for example, CDR (EU) 2024/1774 for the ICT risk management RTS, CDR (EU) 2024/1772 for the incident classification criteria, and CIR (EU) 2024/2956 for the Register of Information template). It explicitly avoids the two most common DORA compliance errors: conflating DORA with NIS2 (DORA is lex specialis for the financial sector; NIS2 applies where DORA does not) and citing the pre-DORA EBA ICT/security Risk guidelines as current standards (those guidelines were superseded by DORA on 17 January 2025).

The skill is particularly comprehensive on **ICT third-party risk management** — the most complex DORA chapter — covering the ICT third-party risk policy, the Register of Information (with all mandatory fields per CIR (EU) 2024/2956), contractual provisions for critical and important ICT arrangements (Art. 30(2) checklist), ICT concentration risk assessment, exit strategy planning, and the oversight framework for Critical ICT Third-Party Service Providers (CTPPs) designated by the ESAs.

### Example Prompts

```
"Run a full DORA gap analysis for a mid-size EU investment firm. We have 
existing ISO 27001 certification, a basic incident response process, and 
a vendor management policy. We do not have a formal DORA ICT risk 
management framework, no Register of Information, and our cloud contracts 
predate DORA. Produce a gap table across all four substantive DORA pillars."
```

```
"We experienced a ransomware incident that encrypted our trading system 
for 8 hours, affecting approximately €2.3M in delayed transactions and 
15,000 client accounts. Walk me through: (1) whether this is a major ICT 
incident under Art. 18, (2) the reporting timeline, and (3) what content 
the initial 4-hour notification must contain."
```

```
"We have 60 ICT service arrangements including AWS (critical), Microsoft 
365, Bloomberg Terminal, and 57 other SaaS vendors. Build us a Register 
of Information structure per CIR (EU) 2024/2956 and identify which 
arrangements require full Art. 30(2) contractual provisions."
```

```
"Review the following ICT service contract with our cloud provider against 
DORA Art. 30(2)(a)–(i) requirements. Identify missing provisions and draft 
the replacement clauses needed for compliance."
```

```
"We are a large payment institution. Do we meet the TLPT threshold under 
Art. 26(8)? If yes, walk us through the complete TLPT process from scope 
definition through competent authority notification and attestation."
