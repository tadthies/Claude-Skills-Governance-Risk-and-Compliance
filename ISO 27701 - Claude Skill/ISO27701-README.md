# ISO/IEC 27701 Privacy Information Management Skill for Claude

> **Disclaimer:** This skill provides informational guidance based on ISO/IEC 27701:2025
> (standalone edition) and ISO/IEC 27701:2019 (extension edition). It does not constitute legal
> advice or a certification guarantee. ISO 27701 certification does not constitute a GDPR safe
> harbor and has not been approved as a formal Article 42 GDPR certification scheme in most EU
> member states. Certification decisions, Statement of Applicability scoping, and regulatory
> interpretation with material legal consequences should be reviewed by a qualified privacy lawyer,
> ISO 27701 Lead Auditor, or accredited certification body.

## 1. What Does the Skill Do?

This skill gives Claude comprehensive expertise in **ISO/IEC 27701** — the international standard
for Privacy Information Management Systems (PIMS). The skill covers both the **ISO 27701:2019**
edition (an extension of ISO 27001, requiring ISO 27001 as a prerequisite) and the current
**ISO/IEC 27701:2025** edition, published 14 October 2025 as a standalone management system
standard — the most significant change being that organisations can now implement and certify a
PIMS without first holding ISO 27001 certification. All 2019 certifications must transition to
the 2025 edition by **October 2028**.

The skill covers the full PIMS lifecycle: gap analysis against all mandatory Clause 4–10
requirements and all 78 Annex A controls (31 PII Controller controls in A.1, 18 PII Processor
controls in A.2, and 29 shared information security controls in A.3); policy and documentation
generation mapped to clause and control; control implementation guidance structured as Purpose →
What to Implement → Evidence → Audit Tips → Regulatory Link; Statement of Applicability (SoA)
generation for controller-only (60 controls), processor-only (47 controls), or dual-role
(78 controls) organisations; privacy risk assessment and DPIA support; and transition guidance
from ISO 27701:2019 to 2025 including control mapping tables.

The skill always clarifies the organisation's role — PII Controller, PII Processor, or both —
before advising on applicable Annex A controls, since this is the fundamental scoping decision.
It leads with GDPR alignment in every explanation of what ISO 27701 is, clearly stating that
certification provides strong evidence of GDPR Arts. 24/32 technical and organisational measures
(TOMs) and accountability under Art. 5(2), while explicitly noting that it is not a GDPR safe
harbor. It also covers regulatory alignment with UK GDPR, CCPA/CPRA, LGPD, PIPEDA, and PDPA.

## 3. Common Use Cases

### Gap Analysis and Certification Readiness

- "Perform an ISO 27701:2025 gap analysis for our organisation. We are both a PII Controller and PII Processor."

### 2019 to 2025 Transition

- "We are ISO 27701:2019 certified. What do we need to do to transition to ISO 27701:2025 by October 2028?"
- "Map the 2019 Annex A controller controls to the 2025 A.1 controls — which are new?"
- "What are the 3 new controller controls and 2 new processor controls added in the 2025 edition?"
- "Can we still certify under ISO 27701:2019 or must we move to 2025?"
- "Does our existing ISO 27001:2022 certification still integrate with ISO 27701:2025?"

### Regulatory Alignment

- "Map ISO 27701 controls to GDPR articles — specifically Art. 5, 13/14, 17, 28, and 35."
- "How does ISO 27701 certification help us demonstrate CCPA/CPRA compliance?"

### Example Prompts

```
We are a B2B SaaS company. We act as a PII Controller for our employee HR data and as
a PII Processor for customer data we process on their behalf. We hold ISO 27001:2022
certification. Perform an ISO 27701:2025 gap analysis covering:
(1) All mandatory Clause 4–10 requirements,
(2) Applicable A.1 controller controls,
(3) Applicable A.2 processor controls,
(4) A.3 shared security controls.
Produce a gap table: Control ID | Control Name | Status | Evidence Needed | Gap Notes.
```

```
Generate a full Statement of Applicability (SoA) for our organisation. We are a PII
Processor only — we do not determine the purposes of processing. Include all Annex A.2
and A.3 controls. For each control include: Applicable (Yes/No) | Justification if Not
Applicable | Implementation Status | Evidence Reference.
```

```
We are ISO 27701:2019 certified. Our transition deadline is October 2028. Produce a
transition roadmap covering:
(1) New and changed controls in 2025 vs 2019 (controller and processor),
(2) Clause structure changes,
(3) Documentation updates required,
(4) How our existing ISO 27001:2022 integration is affected,
(5) Transition audit steps and recommended timeline.
```

```
Draft an ISO 27701:2025-compliant Data Processing Agreement template for use with our
downstream customers. Map each clause to the relevant Annex A control (A.1.2.7 and
Annex A.2). Include all required privacy terms and use ISO 27701 terminology throughout
(PII principal, PII controller, PII processor, sub-processor).
```

```
Map ISO/IEC 27701:2025 Annex A controls to GDPR articles. Produce a three-column table:
ISO 27701 Control ID | Control Name | Corresponding GDPR Article(s).
Focus on: transparency (Arts. 13/14), data subject rights (Arts. 15–22), controller
obligations (Art. 24), processor obligations (Art. 28), DPIAs (Art. 35), and
security (Art. 32).
