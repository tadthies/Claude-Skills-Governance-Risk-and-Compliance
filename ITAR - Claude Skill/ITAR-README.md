# International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) Skill for Claude

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This skill provides informational guidance based on 22 CFR Parts 120–130 and established DDTC regulatory practice. It does not constitute legal advice. ITAR violations carry severe criminal and civil penalties. For matters involving export licence applications, voluntary disclosures, enforcement actions, or complex jurisdiction determinations, consult a qualified export control attorney or your Empowered Official.

## 1. What Does the Skill Do?

The ITAR Compliance Skill transforms Claude into an expert US defense export control advisor with deep knowledge of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (22 CFR Parts 120–130), administered by the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) at the US Department of State. The skill covers the full ITAR compliance lifecycle — from determining whether an item is controlled under the United States Munitions List (USML) through to managing voluntary self-disclosures of violations.

The skill supports eight core workflows: jurisdiction determination (ITAR vs. EAR), DDTC registration guidance, export licensing (DSP-5, DSP-73, DSP-94), Technical Assistance Agreement (TAA) and Manufacturing License Agreement (MLA) drafting and review, deemed export rules for foreign nationals and Technology Control Plans (TCP), brokering regulations under 22 CFR Part 129, voluntary self-disclosure (VSD) process under 22 CFR § 127.12, and compliance programme design including the Empowered Official role.

All responses cite the specific CFR part and section relevant to the question (for example, "22 CFR § 124.1" or "22 CFR § 120.41"). Output format adapts to the task: structured analysis tables for gap assessments, step-by-step checklists for registration and licensing, clause-by-clause guidance for TAA/MLA drafting, and clear prose with CFR citations for general questions.

The skill is backed by three detailed reference files — USML category descriptions for all 21 categories, a licensing guide covering all licence types and exemptions, and a compliance programme reference with the full VSD process, penalty framework, and TCP template — loaded on demand to keep responses precise and efficient.

4. The skill is now active in all Claude sessions

### Triggering the Skill

The skill activates automatically when you raise ITAR or US defense export control topics. No special commands are needed. Example natural-language phrases that trigger the skill:

- *"Is this item ITAR controlled?"*
- *"We need to share technical data with our UK partner"*
- *"What does DDTC require for registration?"*
- *"Explain the deemed export rule"*
- *"We think we may have had an ITAR violation"*
- *"Draft a TAA for our French licensee"*
- *"What is the USML category for night-vision devices?"*

### Example Prompts

```
We manufacture passive infrared sensors used in both commercial security cameras
and military targeting systems. How do we determine if these are ITAR-controlled,
and what is the process if the jurisdiction is unclear?
```

```
Our company has just won a contract to provide engineering support to a foreign
military customer. We plan to share design drawings and provide on-site training.
What ITAR authorisation do we need, and how long does it take to obtain?
```

```
One of our engineers, a citizen of Germany, needs access to ITAR-controlled
technical data for a project. Walk me through our deemed export obligations and
what our Technology Control Plan needs to cover.
```

```
We discovered that one of our subsidiaries shipped ITAR hardware to a distributor
in Singapore without a DSP-5 licence. What is the voluntary self-disclosure
process and what factors will DDTC consider when determining the penalty?
```

```
Conduct an ITAR compliance gap assessment against these programme elements:
registration, TCP, training, screening, licence management, record retention,
and internal audits. Format the output as a table with status and recommended actions.
