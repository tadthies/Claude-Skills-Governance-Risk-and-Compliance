# Brazil Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados (LGPD) Skill for Claude

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This skill provides informational guidance based on Law No. 13,709/2018 (LGPD) as amended by Law No. 13,853/2019 and ANPD resolutions. It does not constitute legal advice. For matters involving ANPD enforcement, high-risk processing, or complex international transfer arrangements, consult a qualified Brazilian data protection lawyer or your designated DPO (Encarregado).

## 1. What Does the Skill Do?

The LGPD Compliance Skill transforms Claude into an expert Brazilian data protection advisor with comprehensive knowledge of the Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais (LGPD) — Law No. 13,709/2018 as amended by Law No. 13,853/2019 — together with all relevant ANPD (Autoridade Nacional de Proteção de Dados) resolutions, including Resolution CD/ANPD No. 15/2024 setting the 3-working-day breach notification requirement.

> **2026 Update — Brazil-EU Mutual Adequacy:** On January 26–27, 2026, the European Commission formally adopted an adequacy decision for Brazil under GDPR Article 45, and Brazil's ANPD simultaneously recognised the EU as an adequate transfer destination. This mutual adequacy **eliminates the need for SCCs, BCRs, or other transfer safeguards for Brazil ↔ EU personal data flows**. The skill has been updated (v1.5.0, July 2026) to reflect this change across the international transfers section, the LGPD vs. GDPR comparison table, and the gap assessment workflow.

The skill covers the full LGPD compliance lifecycle. It analyses processing activities against all 10 legal bases for regular personal data (Art. 7) and the stricter bases for sensitive data (Art. 11), guides organisations through data subject rights fulfilment under Arts. 17–22, produces LGPD-compliant privacy notices containing all Art. 9 required elements, and assists with data breach notification workflows under Art. 48. The skill also supports DPO (Encarregado) appointment under Art. 41, Records of Processing Activities (RoPA) under Art. 37, Data Protection Impact Assessments (RIPD/DPIA) under Art. 38, and international data transfer compliance under Arts. 33–36 — including the landmark Brazil-EU adequacy decision of January 2026.

The skill is particularly valuable for organisations operating across both Brazil and the EU, as it explicitly maps LGPD requirements against GDPR equivalents — highlighting key differences including the 10 vs. 6 legal bases, the 3-working-day vs. 72-hour breach notification timelines, the always-mandatory DPO vs. GDPR's conditional DPO obligation, and the R$50 million vs. €20 million penalty caps.

All responses cite the specific LGPD article relevant to the question (for example, "Art. 7, IX" or "Art. 48, §1º"). Output format adapts to the task: structured gap tables for assessments, step-by-step workflows for breach response and data subject requests, full document templates for privacy notices and RIPDs, and clear prose with article citations for general questions.

### Triggering the Skill

The skill activates automatically when you raise LGPD or Brazilian data protection topics. No special commands are needed. Example natural-language phrases that trigger the skill:

- *"Is this LGPD compliant?"*
- *"We process data for Brazilian users"*
- *"What does the ANPD require for breach notification?"*

### Example Prompts

```
We are a SaaS company based in the US that has recently started offering services
to Brazilian customers. We collect names, emails, and usage analytics. Are we
subject to LGPD, and if so, what are the first five compliance steps we should take?
```

```
We process biometric data (fingerprints) for employee time-tracking at our
Brazilian manufacturing facility. What legal basis can we use under Art. 11,
and what additional safeguards do we need to implement?
```

```
Draft an LGPD-compliant privacy notice for our Brazilian B2C mobile application.
We collect name, email, phone number, location data, and purchase history.
We share data with our payment processor and analytics provider.
```

```
We discovered a ransomware attack that encrypted a database containing personal
data of approximately 50,000 Brazilian customers. Walk us through the complete
ANPD breach notification process including the preliminary and full report requirements.
```

```
Compare our GDPR compliance programme against LGPD requirements and identify
the gaps we need to close. Focus on: DPO obligations, legal bases, breach
notification timelines, children's data rules, and penalty exposure.
