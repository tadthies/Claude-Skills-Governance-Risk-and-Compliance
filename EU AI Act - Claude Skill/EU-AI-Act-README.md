## 1. What Does the Skill Do?

This skill gives Claude deep expertise in **Regulation (EU) 2024/1689** — the EU AI Act —
the world's first comprehensive horizontal AI regulatory framework. Published in the EU Official
Journal on 12 July 2024. **Updated July 2026** with the following material changes:

- **Digital Omnibus formally adopted (June 29, 2026):** The EU formally adopted the Digital Omnibus package, which amends the AI Act. Annex III high-risk deadline confirmed at **2 December 2027** (from 2 August 2026); Annex I embedded-product deadline confirmed at **2 August 2028** (from 2027). These are now law, not pending.
- **AI Office enforcement powers (August 2, 2026 — URGENT):** The AI Office gains full enforcement powers over GPAI providers on **2 August 2026** — one month from now. GPAI providers must have Safety and Security Frameworks submitted and Arts. 53–55 documentation ready for AI Office review.
- **9 prohibited practices:** AI systems generating non-consensual sexually explicit imagery or CSAM added as the **9th prohibition** under Art. 5 (Digital Omnibus), effective 2 December 2026 (with safe harbour for effective preventive safeguards)
- **GPAI Code of Practice:** Final CoP published 10 July 2025; three chapters (Transparency, Copyright, Safety & Security); now the primary compliance pathway. Major signatories: Anthropic, Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, Mistral, Amazon, IBM
- **GPAI classification threshold:** 10²³ FLOPs (Commission guidelines, July 2025) for GPAI obligations; 10²⁵ FLOPs for systemic risk presumption
- **AI Office guidance:** Art. 5 guidelines (Feb 2025), AI system definition guidelines (Feb 2025), GPAI scope guidelines (Jul 2025), Art. 50 consultation (May 2026), classification guidelines consultation (May 2026)

The skill implements an eight-step compliance workflow: identifying the user's role under the
Act (provider, deployer, importer, distributor, authorised representative per Art. 3); classifying
AI systems against the Art. 3(1) definition; screening against all **nine** prohibited practices
under Art. 5; determining the risk tier (prohibited, high-risk Path A under Art. 6(1), high-risk
Path B under Art. 6(2)/Annex III, limited-risk under Art. 50, or minimal risk); walking through
all mandatory high-risk obligations under Arts. 8–17 and 26; determining conformity assessment
pathways and CE marking requirements under Arts. 43–48; assessing GPAI model obligations under
Arts. 53–55 including the 10²³/10²⁵ FLOPs thresholds and GPAI CoP; and covering post-market
monitoring and serious incident reporting obligations.

Every response cites the governing Article, Annex, or Recital. The skill covers all eight Annex
III high-risk use case areas (biometric identification, critical infrastructure, education,
employment, access to services, law enforcement, migration, administration of justice), maps the
full penalty regime under Art. 99 (up to €35M or 7% of global turnover for prohibited practice
violations), and cross-maps to ISO 42001, NIST AI RMF, and GDPR for organisations managing
multiple compliance frameworks simultaneously.

## 3. Common Use Cases

### AI System Classification

- "Classify our CV-screening tool — is it prohibited, high-risk, limited-risk, or minimal risk?"
- "We use a chatbot for customer service. What transparency obligations apply under Art. 50?"
- "Our AI system makes creditworthiness assessments. Is this Annex III high-risk under Point 5(b)?"
- "We're building a real-time biometric identification system for a shopping centre. Is this prohibited?"
- "What is the Art. 3(1) definition of an AI system and does our rules-based system qualify?"

### Prohibited Practices Screen (Art. 5 — enforceable from 2 February 2025)

- "Does our emotion recognition system at workplace entry points violate Art. 5(1)(f)?"
- "We build social scoring tools for an employer. Does this fall under the Art. 5 prohibition?"
- "Our marketing tool uses subliminal techniques to influence purchasing behaviour. Is this prohibited?"
- "What is the narrow law enforcement exception to the real-time remote biometric identification prohibition?"
- "Screen our AI product portfolio against all nine prohibited practices in Art. 5."
- "Does the 9th prohibition added by the Digital Omnibus cover our image generation product?"

### High-Risk System Obligations (Arts. 8–17, 26)

- "Generate a gap assessment for our high-risk AI system against all Arts. 8–17 obligations."

- *"EU AI Act compliance"* or *"Regulation (EU) 2024/1689"*
- *"high-risk AI system"*, *"Annex III"*, *"prohibited AI practices Art. 5"*
- *"GPAI model obligations"*, *"systemic risk AI"*, *"10²⁵ FLOPs threshold"*
- *"CE marking AI"*, *"EU AI database registration"*, *"notified body AI"*
- *"AI Act conformity assessment"*, *"Art. 9 risk management"*, *"Art. 26 deployer"*
- *"AI Act penalties"*, *"AI Office"*, *"AI system classification"*
- *"Digital Omnibus"*, *"AI Office enforcement"*, *"August 2026 GPAI"*

### Example Prompts

```
Classify our AI system: it analyses job applicants' CVs and ranks them for shortlisting.
The system was trained on historical hiring data. We deploy it as an HR tool sold to
enterprise customers across the EU. Apply the full 8-step EU AI Act workflow — start
with role identification, run the Art. 5 prohibited practice screen, determine risk tier,
and list all applicable obligations.
```

```
We are a GPAI model provider. Our model was trained using 3×10²⁵ FLOPs of compute.
We release it under a commercial licence (not open-source). Identify:
(1) whether we cross the Art. 51 systemic risk threshold,
(2) all Art. 53 universal GPAI obligations,
(3) all Art. 55 systemic risk additional obligations,
(4) what we need to have ready for AI Office enforcement powers on August 2, 2026.
```

```
Produce a comprehensive gap analysis for our high-risk AI system (Annex III Point 4 —
employment and workers management) against all mandatory Arts. 8–17 and Art. 26 obligations.
Use a table with: Requirement | Article | Status (Met/Partial/Gap) | Action Required.
```

```
Our AI system performs real-time remote biometric identification for access control at
our company premises. Is this prohibited under Art. 5(1)(h)? What is the scope of
the law enforcement exception and does a private employer benefit from it?
```

```
Map the EU AI Act high-risk obligations to ISO 42001:2023 controls and NIST AI RMF
functions. Produce a three-column mapping table showing: EU AI Act Article | ISO 42001
Control | NIST AI RMF Function/Category.
