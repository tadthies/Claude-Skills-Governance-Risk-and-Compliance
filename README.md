## What Are Claude Skills?

Claude Skills are installable knowledge packages that extend Claude's capabilities for specific domains. A skill is a `.skill` file — a bundled archive containing a `SKILL.md` instruction file and optional reference materials — that you upload to Claude once and use across all your conversations.

Once installed, a skill activates **automatically** when your conversation touches its topic area. You don't need to invoke it by name or use special commands. Claude simply becomes a deeper expert in that domain for the duration of your session.

**Skills are ideal when you need:**
- Consistent, expert-level responses on a specialized topic
- Outputs formatted to professional or regulatory standards (e.g., audit-ready control narratives, policy templates with the right clauses)
- Domain knowledge that goes beyond general LLM training — such as knowing which specific NIST 800-53 controls apply to a given scenario, or which GDPR articles govern international data transfers

**How skills work under the hood:** Each `.skill` file contains a primary `SKILL.md` that is loaded into Claude's context when the skill triggers, plus reference files that are loaded on demand for deeper sub-topics. This "progressive disclosure" pattern keeps context usage efficient while making comprehensive knowledge available when needed.

## Who Is This For?

These skills are designed for professionals who work on information security, privacy, and regulatory compliance — whether at organizations seeking certification, development teams building compliant systems, or advisors supporting clients.

**Security & Compliance Teams** use these skills to accelerate gap assessments, generate first-draft policies, map controls, and prepare evidence packages — compressing weeks of reference work into minutes.

**Software Developers & Engineers** use them to understand what controls their systems must implement, audit code and architecture for compliance issues, and get actionable technical guidance tied to specific regulatory requirements.

**Legal, Privacy & GRC Professionals** use them to draft regulatory documents (DPAs, BAAs, privacy notices), answer client questions with precise regulatory citations, and stay current on framework requirements.

**Healthcare Organizations** use the HIPAA skill to assess systems, generate required notices and agreements, and train staff on obligations — without needing a compliance consultant for every question.

**Cloud Service Providers** pursuing federal government contracts use the FedRAMP skill to navigate the ATO process, write SSP narratives, manage POA&Ms, and prepare for 3PAO assessments.

**Startups and SMBs** use these skills to understand what a given framework requires of them, scope their compliance programs, and get expert-quality output without a large in-house team.

2. Open Claude and navigate to **Customize → Skills**.
3. Click **Upload Skill** and select the `.skill` file.
4. The skill is now active. Start a new conversation and ask your compliance question — Claude will automatically apply the skill.

> **Tip:** You can install multiple skills at once. If you work across several frameworks (e.g., both ISO 27001 and SOC 2), install all of them — Claude will activate whichever is most relevant to each question.

## Install via Claude Code Marketplace

If you use Claude Code — the AI-powered CLI for developers — these skills are also available as installable Claude Code plugins through a hosted marketplace. This is the recommended installation path for developers and teams, as it supports version-pinning, automatic updates, and team-wide distribution without any manual file handling.

Add the marketplace and install the skills you need directly from the terminal:

```shell
/plugin marketplace add Sushegaad/Claude-Skills-Governance-Risk-and-Compliance
/plugin install iso27001@grc-skills soc2@grc-skills fedramp@grc-skills gdpr-compliance@grc-skills hipaa-compliance@grc-skills nist-csf@grc-skills pci-compliance@grc-skills tsa-compliance@grc-skills iso42001@grc-skills iso27701@grc-skills dora@grc-skills dpdpa@grc-skills cmmc@grc-skills nist-ai-rmf@grc-skills swift-csp@grc-skills ism@grc-skills nis2@grc-skills ccpa@grc-skills itar@grc-skills lgpd@grc-skills csrd@grc-skills cis-controls@grc-skills ear@grc-skills nist-800-53@grc-skills eu-ai-act@grc-skills section-508@grc-skills wcag@grc-skills nzism@grc-skills vn-pdpl@grc-skills eu-cra@grc-skills
```

Teams can pre-wire the marketplace in `.claude/settings.json` so every developer gets the skills automatically when they open the project — no manual install required.

## Skill Evaluation

These skills were benchmarked using the [Claude Skill Creator](https://claude.ai) eval framework. **150 realistic test cases** were run across all 30 skills — 5 per framework — with **Claude Sonnet as both the skill-assisted and baseline model** (same model on both sides, so the delta measures the skills, not model strength) — covering gap analysis, policy drafting, control deep-dives, edge cases, and compliance advice scenarios. Each test case was evaluated against at least 5 objectively verifiable assertions (752 in total) by independent grader agents comparing skill-assisted vs. baseline Claude responses.

| Configuration | Pass Rate | Assertions Passed |
|---------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **With GRC Skills installed** | **94%** | **705 / 752** |
| Without skills (baseline Claude) | 81% | 612 / 752 |
| **Delta** | **+13 points** | **+93 assertions** |
