# NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Skill for Claude

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This skill provides informational guidance based on NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5, SP 800-53B, SP 800-53A Rev 5, and SP 800-37 Rev 2. It does not constitute authoritative NIST guidance or legal advice. For formal FISMA authorization decisions, FedRAMP assessments, and ATO packages, consult your Authorizing Official, ISSO, and accredited 3PAO.

## 1. What Does the Skill Do?

The NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 Compliance Skill transforms Claude into an expert federal information security controls advisor with comprehensive knowledge of Special Publication 800-53 Revision 5 — *Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations* — published by NIST in September 2020. The skill guides federal agencies, contractors, cloud service providers, and system owners through the complete Risk Management Framework (RMF) lifecycle from system categorization through authorization and continuous monitoring.

The skill covers all 20 control families (AC through SR) across the Low, Moderate, and High impact baselines as defined in SP 800-53B. It supports FIPS 199 system categorization using the three confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact levels; baseline selection and tailoring including organization-defined value (ODV) assignment, scoping considerations, and overlay application; and SSP narrative writing with the three required components of implementation description, responsible roles, and evidence artifacts.

The skill incorporates the key Rev 5 enhancements: the new Privacy (PT) family with 8 controls addressing PII consent, minimization, and transparency; the new Supply Chain Risk Management (SR) family with 12 controls; outcome-based control statements; and the separation of baselines into SP 800-53B. It also covers SP 800-53A Rev 5 assessment procedures using Examine, Interview, and Test methods, POA&M management, and continuous monitoring strategy.

Cross-framework mapping is a core capability: the skill maps SP 800-53 controls to FedRAMP parameters, FISMA requirements, CMMC 2.0 Level 2 (derived from SP 800-171), ISO 27001:2022, NIST CSF 2.0, HIPAA Security Rule, and PCI DSS v4.0. This makes the skill equally useful for federal agencies pursuing ATO, cloud providers seeking FedRAMP authorization, and private sector organizations benchmarking against federal security standards.

## 4. How to Use the Skill

### Installation
1. Download `nist-800-53.skill` from this folder
2. In Claude, go to **Settings → Skills**
3. Click **Upload Skill** and select `nist-800-53.skill`
4. The skill is now active in all Claude sessions

### Triggering the Skill

The skill activates automatically when you raise NIST SP 800-53, RMF, FISMA, or federal security control topics. No special commands are needed. Example natural-language phrases that trigger the skill:

- *"What does NIST 800-53 require for...?"*
- *"I need to write an SSP narrative for..."*
- *"Help me categorize this system under FIPS 199"*
- *"We're going through FedRAMP authorization"*
- *"What baseline controls apply to a Moderate impact system?"*
- *"Walk me through the RMF steps"*
- *"We have a FISMA assessment coming up"*

### Example Prompts

```
We are categorizing a new federal HR system that processes employee PII including
names, SSNs, salary information, and performance reviews. Walk me through the
FIPS 199 categorization process and tell me which SP 800-53B baseline we should select.
```

```
Write SSP narratives for the following three controls for our AWS GovCloud-hosted
system: AC-2 (Account Management), IA-2(1) (MFA for Privileged Accounts), and
SC-28(1) (Encryption at Rest). Follow the standard three-component format.
```

```
We are a cloud service provider pursuing FedRAMP Moderate authorization. Our
assessors found 12 OTS findings. Help me build a POA&M with appropriate risk
levels, remediation timelines, and milestone descriptions for each finding.
```

```
Map the following SP 800-53 Rev 5 control families to their ISO 27001:2022 Annex A
equivalents and identify controls in each catalog that have no direct mapping counterpart:
AC, AU, IA, SC, and SI families.
```

```
We need to apply the Supply Chain Risk Management (SR) family controls for our
federal system. Explain each of the 12 SR controls, which baseline they apply to,
and provide implementation guidance for a Moderate impact system.
```
