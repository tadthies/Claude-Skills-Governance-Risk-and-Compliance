## Article 6 — Valid Consent Methods

Consent must be expressly given using one of the following verifiable methods:

1. **Written consent** — signed paper document or electronic document with digital signature

- Assessment must cover all personal data processing activities, legal bases, and security controls

**Audit logs:**
- Maintain detailed periodic audit logs of access to personal data systems
- Audit logs must record: who accessed data, when, what data was accessed, and the purpose

**Breach notification:**
- 72-hour notification to the personal data protection authority (same as general rule)
- ADDITIONALLY: notify the affected **data subjects** within 72 hours (for finance sector, data subject notification is mandatory simultaneously with authority notification)

**Data retention:**
- Financial transaction data must be retained for the period prescribed by financial sector regulations
- Personal data no longer needed for the processing purpose must be deleted or de-identified

**Third-party processors:**
- Written data processing agreements required with all outsourced processors
- Annual security assessments of critical third-party processors recommended

## Article 9 — Big Data Processing

Organisations processing personal data at **large scale or using big data analytics:**

**Security controls:**
- Implement **strong authentication** (multi-factor authentication) for all access to big data environments
- Apply **encryption or anonymisation** techniques appropriate to the sensitivity of the data
- Implement **continuous monitoring** for anomalous access patterns and potential breaches
- Conduct periodic penetration testing and vulnerability assessments

**Data minimisation:**
- Big data collection must still comply with purpose limitation — collect only what is demonstrably necessary
- Regularly purge data that is no longer required for the specified purpose

**Transparency:**
- Publish clear notices on big data collection practices
- Provide opt-out mechanisms for data subjects where feasible

---

## Article 10 — AI and Automated Processing

For personal data processing using **artificial intelligence, machine learning, or automated decision-making:**

**Right to opt out:**
- Data subjects must be informed when their data is used in automated processing
- Data subjects have the right to **opt out of automated processing** that produces decisions significantly affecting them
- Opt-out mechanisms must be simple and accessible

**Periodic assessment:**
- Organisations must conduct **periodic assessments** of AI/automated systems processing personal data
- Assessments must evaluate: accuracy, bias, impact on data subject rights, and security
- Assessment results must be documented and acted upon

**Transparency:**
- Inform data subjects when an AI system processes their data, what type of processing is involved, and the likely outcomes
- Do not use AI processing in ways that could be considered deceptive or manipulative

**High-risk AI:**
- Where AI is used for profiling, credit scoring, employment decisions, or other high-stakes decisions, enhanced transparency and data subject rights apply

## Article 11 — Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology

Special rules for personal data in **blockchain and DLT systems:**

**Core prohibition:** Personal data must **NOT be stored directly on a public or permissioned blockchain** where deletion or modification is technically infeasible.

**Permitted approaches:**
- Store **only de-identified data or cryptographic hash values** on-chain
- Maintain personal data in off-chain storage with only hashes or references on-chain
- Use private/permissioned chains with strict access controls if direct storage is unavoidable for the use case

**Data subject rights:**
- Controllers using blockchain must have a technical mechanism to fulfil deletion, correction, and access requests off-chain
- Where on-chain data cannot be deleted, document the technical impossibility and implement compensating controls

**Security:**
- Apply cryptographic controls appropriate to the sensitivity of the data
- Conduct regular security assessments of smart contracts and consensus mechanisms

---

## Article 12 — Cloud Computing Services

Special rules for personal data processed in **cloud environments:**

**Encryption requirements:**
- Encrypt personal data **at rest** and **in transit**
- Use encryption keys managed by the controller (or with appropriate key management controls)
- Apply encryption standards appropriate to the sensitivity of the data

**Access control:**
- Implement **access delegation controls** — cloud provider access to personal data should be limited to what is technically necessary for service delivery
- Document cloud provider access rights and review regularly

**Data residency:**
- For cloud storage of employee HR data, Article 20 cross-border transfer exemption may apply if data is used solely for HR administration purposes
- Confirm with legal counsel whether the specific cloud use case qualifies for the exemption

**Due diligence:**
- Conduct security assessments of cloud service providers before onboarding
- Include VN-PDPL compliance obligations in cloud service agreements
- Verify data centre locations and applicable security certifications (ISO 27001, SOC 2, etc.)

**Incident response:**
- Cloud providers must notify controllers immediately on becoming aware of a breach affecting personal data
- Controllers remain responsible for the 72-hour notification to the authority

## Practical Guidance by Sector

### E-commerce and Retail
- Consent must be collected at point of registration and separately for marketing communications
