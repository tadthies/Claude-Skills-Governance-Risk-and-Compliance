## How to Respond

**Version selection — read context carefully before defaulting:**
- If the user mentions an **existing ISO 27001 certification** or asks about "extending"
  ISO 27001, lead with the **2019 edition extension model** (ISO 27001 is a prerequisite
  in 2019; ISO 27701:2019 cannot be certified standalone). Then note that the 2025 edition
  is now standalone and integration is still fully supported.
- If the user is starting fresh with **no existing ISO 27001**, default to **2025**
  (standalone standard, ISO 27001 no longer a prerequisite).
- If unspecified and context is unclear, default to **2025** but note the 2019 edition
  is still the most widely certified and requires ISO 27001 as a prerequisite.

**Always mention GDPR alignment in your first paragraph when explaining what ISO 27701
is.** ISO 27701 was specifically designed to help organizations demonstrate compliance
with GDPR, UK GDPR, and similar privacy regulations — this is its primary value
proposition and users need to hear this upfront, not buried in a regulatory table.

Also clarify the organization's role: **PII Controller**, **PII Processor**, or
**both** — this determines which Annex A controls apply.

Match your output to the task type:

| Task | Output Format |
|------|--------------|
| Gap analysis | Table: Control ID \| Control Name \| Status \| Evidence Needed \| Gap Notes |
| Policy generation | Full structured policy document |
| Control guidance | Structured guidance: Purpose → What to Do → Evidence → Audit Tips |
| SoA generation | Table with Applicable / Justification / Status columns |
| Privacy risk assessment | Risk register table |
| DPIA | Structured DPIA template |
| General question | Clear, concise prose |

## Standard Overview

### ISO 27701:2025 — Standalone PIMS (Current)

ISO/IEC 27701:2025 ("Information security, cybersecurity and privacy protection —
Privacy information management systems — Requirements and guidance") was published
**14 October 2025** as the second edition. Its most significant change: it is now a
**standalone management system standard** — organizations can implement and certify
a PIMS without first implementing ISO 27001.

The standard adopts the **ISO High-Level Structure (HLS)** (same framework as
ISO 27001:2022 and ISO 42001:2023), making integration with other management systems
straightforward. Integration with ISO 27001 is still fully supported and encouraged.

**Annex A structure (78 total controls):**
- **A.1**: PII Controller controls — 31 controls across 4 domains
- **A.2**: PII Processor controls — 18 controls across 4 domains
- **A.3**: Shared information security controls — 29 controls
- **Annex B**: Implementation guidance (new in 2025)

**Transition deadline for 2019 certified organizations: October 2028**

### ISO 27701:2019 — Extension Edition (Legacy)

The 2019 edition extended ISO 27001:2013 and ISO 27002:2013 and required ISO 27001
certification as a prerequisite. Controls were split across Annex A (controller) and
Annex B (processor). All 2019 certifications must transition to 2025 by October 2028.

For detailed transition guidance, read `references/transition-guide.md`.

## Clause Structure (HLS Clauses 4–10)

All mandatory PIMS requirements live in Clauses 4–10. No clause may be excluded:

| Clause | Title | Key PIMS Deliverables |
|--------|-------|----------------------|
| 4 | Context of the Organization | PIMS Scope document, PII data inventory, interested parties register (focus: PII principals, regulators, customers) |
| 5 | Leadership | Privacy Policy (signed by top management), privacy roles and responsibilities, DPO appointment where required |
| 6 | Planning | Privacy risk assessment process, privacy risk treatment plan, Statement of Applicability (SoA), privacy objectives |
| 7 | Support | Privacy training records, awareness programme, competence evidence, documented information procedures |
| 8 | Operation | Executed privacy risk assessments, DPIAs, Records of Processing Activities (RoPA), incident response records, DSR handling records |
| 9 | Performance Evaluation | Privacy KPIs, internal audit reports, management review minutes, monitoring and measurement results |
| 10 | Improvement | Privacy nonconformity records, corrective action log, lessons learned from incidents |

## Core Workflows

### 1. Gap Analysis

When asked to perform or help with a gap analysis:
1. Clarify: version (2019/2025), role (controller/processor/both), sector, existing
   frameworks (ISO 27001, GDPR programme, etc.)
2. Produce a table covering ALL mandatory clause requirements (4–10) + applicable
   Annex A controls
3. For each item: **Status** (Implemented / Partial / Not Implemented / N/A),
   **Evidence Needed**, **Gap Notes**
4. Summarise critical gaps and recommended priority order
5. Offer to generate a remediation roadmap

**Status definitions:**
- ✅ Implemented — control/requirement is fully in place with evidence
- 🟡 Partial — some evidence exists but gaps remain
- ❌ Not Implemented — no evidence of implementation
- N/A — documented exclusion in SoA with justification

**Key gap areas to probe first:**
- Records of Processing Activities (RoPA) — does one exist and is it current?
- Data Subject Rights procedure — documented, tested, within response SLAs?
- Consent management — lawful basis documented for every processing activity?
- Data transfer mechanisms (SCCs, BCRs, adequacy) — documented per transfer?
- Privacy by design — embedded in SDLC / product development process?
- Processor contracts — do all include required privacy clauses (A.1.2.7)?
- Privacy risk assessment methodology — defined, applied, and recorded?
- DPO / privacy role — appointed, resourced, and empowered?
- DPIA process — triggered for high-risk processing, completed with records?

Consult `references/annex-a-controls.md` for the full control listing.

### 2. Policy & Document Generation

When generating policies or documents:
- Always include: Purpose, Scope, Policy Statement, Roles & Responsibilities,
  Procedures/Controls, Review Cycle, References
- Map each document to the relevant clause(s) and Annex A control(s)
- Include a document control block: Version | Author | Approved By | Date | Next Review

**Core PIMS documents and their primary mappings:**

| Document | Clause | Annex A (2025) |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| Privacy Policy | 5.2 | A.1.2.2 / A.2.2.2 |
| PIMS Scope | 4.3 | — |
| Privacy Risk Assessment | 6.1 | — |
| Statement of Applicability | 6.1 | All of A.1, A.2, A.3 |
| Records of Processing Activities (RoPA) | 8 | A.1.2.9 / A.2.2.7 |
| Privacy Notice / Transparency Notice | 8 | A.1.3.3, A.1.3.4 |
| Data Subject Rights Procedure | 8 | A.1.3.5–A.1.3.11 |
| Privacy by Design Procedure | 8 | A.1.4.2–A.1.4.10 |
| Data Transfer Procedure | 8 | A.1.5.2–A.1.5.5 |
| Data Processing Agreement (DPA) | 8 | A.1.2.7 / A.2 |
| Subcontractor Management Policy | 8 | A.2.5.7–A.2.5.9 |
| Privacy Incident Response Plan | 8 | A.3.11, A.3.12 |
| DPIA Template and Procedure | 8 | A.1.2.6 |
| Internal Audit Procedure | 9.2 | — |
| Management Review Agenda | 9.3 | — |

### 3. Control Implementation Guidance

For any Annex A control, structure your response as:

**Control: [ID] [Name]**
- **Purpose**: Why this control exists / what privacy risk it addresses
- **What to implement**: Concrete, actionable steps
- **Evidence for audit**: What an auditor will look for
- **Common pitfalls**: What teams typically miss
- **Regulatory link**: Which GDPR article / regulation this addresses

Consult `references/annex-a-controls.md` for full control listings with descriptions.

**When covering PII Processor (Annex A.2) obligations, always use ISO 27701's own
terminology — these are the exact phrases auditors and clients will look for:**

| Obligation | ISO 27701 Term | Primary Control |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Acting on controller instructions | "processing under controller authority" | A.2.2.1 |
| Helping controllers respond to individual rights requests | "**PII subject rights assistance obligations**" | A.2.3.3 |
| Use and disclosure of sub-processors | "**sub-processor** notification and consent" | A.2.2.6 |
| Contracts with downstream processors | "**sub-processor** contracts" | A.2.5.8 |
| Privacy by design in processor services | "privacy by design and by default" | A.2.7.1 |

Using these exact ISO 27701 terms (rather than paraphrasing) matters: they map
directly to audit evidence requests and DPA contractual clauses.

### 4. Privacy Risk Assessment

Privacy risks differ from security risks — they concern **harm to PII principals**
(individuals whose data is processed), not just organizational harm.

**Risk register columns:**
Processing Activity | Personal Data Types | PII Principals Affected | Threat |
Vulnerability | Likelihood (1–5) | Severity of Harm (1–5) | Risk Score |
Treatment | Control(s) | Owner | Due Date | Residual Risk

**Treatment options:** Accept | Avoid | Transfer | Mitigate

**DPIA trigger criteria** — a DPIA is required when processing is likely to result in
high risk to individuals, especially when:
- Systematic profiling with significant effects
- Processing of special category data at scale
- Systematic monitoring of public areas
- New technologies with untested privacy implications

**Important:** The SoA must reflect the controls selected through the risk treatment process.

### 5. Statement of Applicability (SoA)

**SoA columns for ISO 27701:2025:**

| Control ID | Control Name | Applicable? | If Not: Justification | Implementation Status | Evidence Reference |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------|

**Role-based SoA scope:**
- **PII Controller only**: Include A.1 (31 controls) + A.3 (29 controls) = 60 controls
- **PII Processor only**: Include A.2 (18 controls) + A.3 (29 controls) = 47 controls
- **Both controller and processor**: Include A.1 + A.2 + A.3 = 78 controls

**Implementation Status values:**
Implemented | Partially Implemented | Planned | Not Applicable

## Key Statements to Make Explicit

These points are frequently asked, frequently misunderstood, and must be stated clearly
whenever they are relevant — do not leave them implied:

**On GDPR compliance:**
- ISO 27701 is **not a GDPR safe harbor**. Certification does not guarantee GDPR
  compliance and does not shield an organization from regulatory enforcement.
- ISO 27701 has **not been approved as a formal Article 42 GDPR certification scheme**
  in most EU member states — it therefore carries no legal presumption of compliance.
- What it *does* provide: strong evidence of Article 24/32 technical and organisational
  measures (TOMs) and accountability documentation under Article 5(2).

**On certification requirements (version-specific):**
- **ISO 27701:2019** requires ISO 27001 as a prerequisite — it **cannot be certified
  as a standalone standard**. Organizations must hold (or pursue simultaneously) ISO
  27001 certification.
- **ISO 27701:2025** is a standalone standard — ISO 27001 is no longer a prerequisite,
  though integration is fully supported and commonly pursued together.
- The 2019 edition is still the most widely certified; most existing certifications are
  under 2019. Transition to 2025 is required by **October 2028**.

**On scope limitations:**
- ISO 27701 certification only covers the defined PIMS scope. Processing activities
  outside that scope receive no certification coverage.
- Historical violations (pre-certification) are not remedied by achieving certification.

## Regulatory Alignment Quick Reference

ISO 27701:2025 includes an updated GDPR correspondence annex and aligns with major
global privacy regulations. For detailed mappings, read `references/regulatory-mapping.md`.

| Regulation | Alignment Summary |
|-----------|-------------------|
| GDPR (EU) | Direct alignment — updated correspondence annex; SoA serves as compliance evidence (not a safe harbor — see above) |
| UK GDPR | Same as EU GDPR; UK ICO recognizes ISO 27701 as meaningful evidence |
| CCPA/CPRA (California) | Covers data rights, processing records, vendor obligations |
| LGPD (Brazil) | Strong alignment with controller/processor obligations and data rights |
| PIPEDA (Canada) | Maps to the 10 Fair Information Principles |
| PDPA (Singapore/Thailand) | Controls align with consent, purpose limitation, correction rights |
