## How to Respond

Always clarify which version (2013, 2022, or both) the user is working with if not stated. Default to **2022** if unspecified.

Match your output to the task type:

| Task | Output Format |
|------|--------------|
| Gap analysis | Table: Control ID | Control Name | Status | Evidence Needed | Gap Notes |
| Policy generation | Full structured policy document |
| Control guidance | Structured guidance: Purpose → What to Do → Evidence → Audit Tips |
| Risk assessment | Risk register table or narrative |
| SoA generation | Spreadsheet-style table |
| General question | Clear, concise prose |

---

## Standard Structure

### Mandatory Clauses (4–10) — Apply to ALL versions
Both 2013 and 2022 share the same clause framework. The 2022 version added minor structural sub-clauses (6.3, split 9.2, split 9.3) but no new obligations.

| Clause | Title | Key Deliverables |
|--------|-------|-----------------|
| 4 | Context of the Organization | ISMS Scope document, stakeholder register |
| 5 | Leadership | IS Policy (signed by top mgmt), RACI/roles doc |
| 6 | Planning | Risk assessment, risk treatment plan, SoA, IS objectives |
| 7 | Support | Competence records, awareness training logs, documented info procedures |
| 8 | Operation | Executed risk assessments, risk treatment evidence, change records |
| 9 | Performance Evaluation | KPIs/metrics, internal audit reports, management review minutes |
| 10 | Improvement | Nonconformity records, corrective action log |

### Annex A Controls
- **2022 version**: 93 controls in 4 themes → read `references/annex-a-2022.md`
- **2013 version**: 114 controls in 14 domains → read `references/annex-a-2013.md`
- **Cross-version mapping**: read `references/control-mapping.md`

## Core Workflows

### 1. Gap Analysis
When asked to perform or help with a gap analysis:
1. Ask for: version (2013/2022), scope of ISMS, industry/sector if relevant
2. Produce a table covering ALL applicable clause requirements + selected Annex A themes
3. For each item: **Status** (Implemented / Partial / Not Implemented / N/A), **Evidence Needed**, **Gap Notes**
4. Summarise critical gaps and recommended priority order
5. Offer to generate a remediation roadmap

**Status definitions:**
- ✅ Implemented — control/requirement is fully in place with evidence
- 🟡 Partial — some evidence exists but gaps remain
- ❌ Not Implemented — no evidence of implementation
- N/A — documented exclusion in SoA with justification

### 2. Policy & Document Generation
When generating policies or documents:
- Always include: Purpose, Scope, Policy Statement, Roles & Responsibilities, Procedures/Controls, Review Cycle, References
- Map each policy to the relevant ISO 27001 clause(s) and Annex A control(s)
- Include a document control block: Version | Author | Approved By | Date | Next Review

**Common policy types and their primary mappings:**
| Policy | Clause | Annex A (2022) |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Information Security Policy | 5.2 | A.5.1 |
| Access Control Policy | 8.1 | A.5.15–5.18 |
| Risk Assessment & Treatment | 6.1–6.2 | — |
| Incident Response Policy | 8.1 | A.5.24–5.28 |
| Asset Management Policy | 8.1 | A.5.9–5.12 |
| Supplier Security Policy | 8.1 | A.5.19–5.22 |
| Business Continuity Policy | 8.1 | A.5.29–5.30 |
| Cryptography Policy | 8.1 | A.8.24 |
| Clear Desk / Clear Screen | 8.1 | A.7.7 |
| Acceptable Use Policy | 8.1 | A.5.10 |
| Human Resources Security | 7.2, 8.1 | A.6.1–6.8 |

### 3. Control Implementation Guidance
For any Annex A control, structure your response as:

**Control: [ID] [Name]**
- **Purpose**: Why this control exists
- **What to implement**: Concrete, actionable steps
- **Evidence for audit**: What an auditor will look for
- **Common pitfalls**: What teams typically miss
- **2013→2022 note** (if applicable): What changed

Consult `references/annex-a-2022.md` for full control descriptions.

### 4. Risk Assessment Support
When helping with risk assessment or risk register:
1. Use the standard **likelihood × impact** methodology
2. Risk register columns: Asset | Threat | Vulnerability | Likelihood (1–5) | Impact (1–5) | Risk Score | Treatment Option | Control(s) | Owner | Due Date | Residual Risk
3. Treatment options: **Accept | Avoid | Transfer | Mitigate**
4. Remind user: SoA must reflect selected controls from risk treatment
5. Offer to generate a Risk Treatment Plan (RTP) after the register

## Mandatory Documentation Checklist

Produce this as a checklist when asked for certification readiness:

**Mandatory records (ISO 27001:2022):**
- [ ] ISMS Scope (4.3)
- [ ] Information Security Policy (5.2)
- [ ] Risk assessment process (6.1.2)
- [ ] Risk treatment process (6.1.3)
- [ ] Statement of Applicability (6.1.3d)
- [ ] Information security objectives (6.2)
- [ ] Evidence of competence (7.2)
- [ ] Operational planning results (8.1)
- [ ] Risk assessment results (8.2)
- [ ] Risk treatment results (8.3)
- [ ] Monitoring & measurement results (9.1)
- [ ] Internal audit programme + results (9.2)
- [ ] Management review results (9.3)
- [ ] Nonconformities + corrective actions (10.1)

---

## Reference Files

Load the appropriate reference file based on the task:

- `references/annex-a-2022.md` — Full list of all 93 Annex A controls (2022) with descriptions
- `references/annex-a-2013.md` — Full list of all 114 Annex A controls (2013)
- `references/control-mapping.md` — Cross-reference table: 2013 ↔ 2022 control mapping

**When to load reference files:**
- User asks about a specific control → load the relevant version's reference file
- Performing gap analysis → load both version files if cross-version
- Generating SoA → load annex-a-2022.md (or 2013 if specified)
- Transition assessment → load control-mapping.md
