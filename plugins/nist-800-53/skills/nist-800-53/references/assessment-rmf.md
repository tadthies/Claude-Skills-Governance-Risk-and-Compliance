# NIST SP 800-53 — Assessment, RMF, ConMon, and Framework Mapping Reference

## SP 800-53A Rev 5 — Assessment Procedures

### Purpose

SP 800-53A Rev 5 (January 2022) provides **assessment procedures** for every control in SP 800-53 Rev 5. Each procedure specifies:

1. **Objectives** — what the assessment must determine
2. **Methods** — Examine, Interview, or Test
3. **Objects** — what to examine/interview/test

### The Three Assessment Methods

| Method | Description | Examples |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Examine** | Review artifacts and documentation | Policy documents, SSP, configuration files, system logs, architecture diagrams, audit records, training records |
| **Interview** | Discuss implementation with personnel | ISSO, system owner, help desk, IT administrators, end users, senior leaders |
| **Test** | Exercise mechanisms directly | Vulnerability scans, penetration tests, configuration checks, firewall rule reviews, backup restoration tests |

### Assessment Depth

| Depth | Description | When Used |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Basic** | Check for existence of controls | Initial assessments; Low impact systems |
| **Focused** | Evaluate implementation | Most common approach |
| **Comprehensive** | Thorough, in-depth assessment | High impact systems; 3PAO assessments |

### Security Assessment Report (SAR) Structure

The SAR documents assessment results:

1. **Executive Summary** — High-level findings and authorization recommendation
2. **Assessment Scope** — Systems, components, controls assessed
3. **Assessment Methodology** — Methods used, depth, timeframe
4. **Findings** — Control-by-control results
5. **Weaknesses and Deficiencies** — OTS (Other Than Satisfied) findings
6. **Risk Exposure** — Risk ratings for identified weaknesses
7. **Recommendations** — Remediation actions

**Finding format:**
```
Control: AC-2(3)
Objective: Determine if inactive accounts are disabled within the defined period.
Status: Other Than Satisfied
Finding: Audit of Active Directory accounts identified 47 accounts inactive for >120 days; 
         ODV is 90 days. Automated account review process is not functioning correctly.
Risk: Moderate — dormant accounts represent attack surface for credential-based attacks.
Recommendation: Fix automated review process; immediately disable the 47 identified accounts.
```

## Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M)

### POA&M Purpose

The POA&M (CA-5) is a living document tracking all security weaknesses found during assessments, continuous monitoring, and self-assessment. Required for all federal systems.

### POA&M Required Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| POA&M ID | Unique identifier |
| Weakness/Deficiency | Description of the finding |
| Source | How discovered (scan, audit, assessment, pen test) |
| Control ID | Related SP 800-53 control |
| Risk Level | Critical / High / Moderate / Low |
| Scheduled Completion Date | When remediation will be complete |
| Milestone Description | Steps to remediate with dates |
| Resources Required | Staff, tools, budget |
| Status | Open / Completed / Delayed / Risk Accepted |

### POA&M Timelines (FedRAMP Guidance)

| Risk Level | Remediation Deadline |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Critical | 30 days |
| High | 90 days |
| Moderate | 180 days |
| Low | 1 year |
| Operational Requirement | Risk accepted; ISSO/SO signature required |

### Risk Acceptance

When a weakness cannot be remediated within the standard timeline:
- Document a **Risk Acceptance** with business justification
- ISSO and System Owner must sign off
- Authorizing Official (AO) may need to approve for High/Critical
- Review at each ConMon cycle
- Cannot be risk-accepted indefinitely for High/Critical findings

## Risk Management Framework (RMF) — SP 800-37 Rev 2

### Step 1 — Prepare

**Purpose:** Establish the organizational and system context for managing security and privacy risk.

**Key tasks:**
- Assign roles: Authorizing Official (AO), System Owner (SO), ISSO, Senior Agency IS Official (SAISO)
- Develop or update organizational risk management strategy (PM-9)
- Identify common controls (PM-10)
- Conduct mission/business process analysis (PM-11)
- Perform organization-level risk assessment (RA-3)
- Establish information life cycle for the system

**Output:** Risk management roles assigned; organization-level risk assessment completed; common control inventory established.

### Step 2 — Categorize

**Purpose:** Categorize the system and information processed, stored, and transmitted based on FIPS 199.

**Key tasks:**
- Describe the system (SSP Section 1 and 2)
- Identify information types using SP 800-60
- Determine impact levels for C, I, A
- Determine overall system impact level (high-water mark)
- Document in the Security Categorization document

**Output:** System Security Categorization document (signed by AO and SO).

### Step 3 — Select

**Purpose:** Select, tailor, and document the controls for the system.

**Key tasks:**
- Select starting baseline from SP 800-53B (Low/Moderate/High)
- Apply tailoring (common controls, scoping, ODVs, compensating controls)
- Document all tailoring decisions in the SSP
- Develop continuous monitoring strategy (CA-7)
- Review and approve control selection (AO concurrence)

**Output:** SSP with control selection; ConMon strategy.

### Step 4 — Implement

**Purpose:** Implement the controls and document how they are deployed in the operational environment.

**Key tasks:**
- Implement the selected controls
- Document implementation in SSP (one narrative per control)
- Document design and implementation information for developer controls (SA-4)
- Identify and address supply chain risks (SR family)

**Output:** Implemented controls; completed SSP implementation narratives.

### Step 5 — Assess

**Purpose:** Determine if the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting security and privacy requirements.

**Key tasks:**
- Develop Security Assessment Plan (SAP) using SP 800-53A
- Select qualified assessors (independent for Moderate/High; 3PAO for FedRAMP)
- Conduct assessments (examine, interview, test)
- Document findings in SAR
- Develop initial POA&M from SAR findings

**Output:** SAP, SAR, initial POA&M.

**Independence requirements:**
- **Low systems:** Self-assessment permitted
- **Moderate systems:** Independent assessor (different team from implementers)
- **High systems / FedRAMP:** 3PAO required; must be accredited by A2LA/FedRAMP PMO

### Step 6 — Authorize

**Purpose:** Provide organizational accountability by requiring a senior official to determine if the security and privacy risk to organizational operations/assets is acceptable.

**Authorization package contents:**
1. System Security Plan (SSP)
2. Security Assessment Report (SAR)
3. Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M)
4. Executive Summary (for AO review)

**Authorization decisions:**
- **Authorization to Operate (ATO)** — risk is acceptable; typically granted for 3 years
- **Common Control Authorization (CCA)** — for common control providers
- **Denial of Authorization to Operate (DATO)** — risk is not acceptable; system must be shut down or remediated
- **Authorization to Use (ATU)** — for external systems/services

**Ongoing authorization:** Continuous authorization (preferred for Moderate/High) replaces periodic re-authorization with real-time risk management.

### Step 7 — Monitor

**Purpose:** Maintain ongoing situational awareness about the security and privacy posture of the system.

**Key tasks:**
- Implement ConMon strategy (CA-7)
- Conduct ongoing assessments of selected controls
- Respond to changes in system and threat environment
- Report security status to AO
- Update SSP, SAR, POA&M as changes occur
- Conduct ongoing risk determination and acceptance

**FedRAMP ConMon requirements:**
- Monthly vulnerability scans (OS, databases, web apps)
- Annual penetration test (conducted by 3PAO)
- Monthly POA&M updates
- Significant change request before major system changes
- Annual security reviews
