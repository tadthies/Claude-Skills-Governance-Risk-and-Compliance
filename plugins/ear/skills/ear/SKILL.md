## How to Respond

Match output format to task type:

| Task | Output Format |
|------|--------------|
| ECCN classification | Step-by-step: jurisdiction → CCL search → ECCN or EAR99 determination |
| License analysis | Country Chart check → license exception availability → license required? |
| Restricted party screening | List-by-list guidance with red flags and next steps |
| Compliance programme review | Gap table: Element | Status | Priority | Action |
| General question | Precise prose with Part/Section citations (e.g., § 734.3, § 740.17) |

Always cite the specific Part and Section (e.g., "Part 740, § 740.13" or "15 CFR § 736.2(b)(1)"). Distinguish EAR terminology precisely: "export," "reexport," and "transfer (in-country)" have different definitions under § 734.14–734.16.

## EAR Framework Overview

**Administered by:** Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), U.S. Department of Commerce  
**Regulatory authority:** Export Control Reform Act of 2018 (ECRA), codified at 50 U.S.C. § 4801 et seq.  
**Scope:** Dual-use items — commodities, software, and technology not exclusively controlled by another U.S. agency

### Parts Structure

| Parts | Subject |
|-------|---------|
| 730–734 | General information, scope, definitions |
| 736 | Ten General Prohibitions |
| 738 | Commerce Control List (CCL) overview and Country Chart |
| 740 | License Exceptions |
| 742 | Control policy — CCL-based controls |
| 744 | End-user and end-use controls |
| 745 | Chemical Weapons Convention requirements |
| 746 | Embargoes and other special controls |
| 748 | License applications and documentation |
| 750 | License review process |
| 758 | Export clearance requirements (EEI, SED) |
| 762 | Recordkeeping requirements |
| 764 | Enforcement, violations, sanctions |
| 766 | Administrative enforcement proceedings |
| 772 | Definitions |
| 774 | The Commerce Control List (CCL) — Supplement No. 1 |

---

## Step 1 — Jurisdiction Determination (Order of Review)

Before classifying under the EAR, apply the mandatory **Order of Review**:

1. **ITAR first:** Is the item on the USML (22 CFR Part 121)? If yes → ITAR jurisdiction (DDTC), not EAR
2. **Other agencies:** NRC (nuclear reactors), FDA, DEA, ATF?
3. **Subject to EAR:** Does the item meet § 734.3 criteria (US-origin, in US territory, or certain foreign items)?
4. **CCL classification:** Look up the item in Part 774 to find its ECCN or confirm EAR99

**Commodity Jurisdiction (CJ) Requests:** When jurisdiction between ITAR and EAR is ambiguous, submit a CJ request to DDTC. BIS also accepts **CCATS (Commodity Classification Automated Tracking System)** requests to obtain an official ECCN determination.

---

## Step 2 — ECCN Classification

### ECCN Format: [Category][Product Group][3-digit sequence]
Example: **3A001** = Category 3 (Electronics) + Product Group A (Equipment) + sequence 001

### CCL Categories (0–9)

| Category | Subject Matter |
|----------|---------------|
| 0 | Nuclear materials, facilities, and equipment |
| 1 | Chemicals, microorganisms, and toxins |
| 2 | Materials processing |
| 3 | Electronics |
| 4 | Computers |
| 5 | Telecommunications and information security |
| 6 | Sensors and lasers |
| 7 | Navigation and avionics |
| 8 | Marine systems |
| 9 | Aerospace and propulsion systems |

### Product Groups (A–E)

| Group | Content |
|-------|---------|
| A | Equipment, assemblies, and components (end items) |
| B | Test, inspection, and production equipment |
| C | Materials |
| D | Software |
| E | Technology |

### Reasons for Control (RFCs)

| Code | Reason |
|------|--------|
| AT | Anti-Terrorism |
| CB | Chemical & Biological Weapons |
| CC | Crime Control |
| CW | Chemical Weapons Convention |
| EI | Encryption Items |
| MT | Missile Technology |
| NP | Nuclear Nonproliferation |
| NS | National Security |
| RS | Regional Stability |
| UN | United Nations Embargo |

### EAR99 Determination

If an item is subject to EAR but NOT listed on the CCL → it is **EAR99**.

> **Critical:** EAR99 is a classification, **not** a license exemption. EAR99 items still require a license if destined for: embargoed countries (Part 746), prohibited end-users (Part 744), WMD end-uses (§ 744.2–744.6), or parties on restricted lists.

---

## Step 3 — License Requirement Analysis

Three factors determine license requirement:

1. **ECCN's Reasons for Control** (column in CCL entry)
2. **Destination country** (Commerce Country Chart in Part 738, Supplement No. 1) — look up RFC × Country to find "X" (license required)
3. **License exception availability** (Part 740) — can an exception authorize the transaction?

### Country Groups (Referenced by License Exceptions)

| Group | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| A:1 | Wassenaar Arrangement members |
| A:2 | Australia Group members |
| A:3 | MTCR adherents |
| A:4 | Nuclear Suppliers Group |
| A:5 | 42 allied/partner countries (most license-friendly) |
| A:6 | AUKUS partners |
| B | Most countries (less restrictive destination) |
| D:1 | National security-controlled countries (Russia, China, etc.) |
| D:2 | Nuclear nonproliferation concern |
| D:3 | Chemical/biological concern |
| D:4 | Missile technology concern |
| D:5 | Arms embargo countries |
| E:1 | Embargoed: Cuba, North Korea, Syria, Iran |
| E:2 | Enhanced embargoed: Russia, Belarus |

| Symbol | Name | Scope |
|--------|------|-------|
| LVS | Limited Value Shipments | Low-value items per ECCN entry |
| GBS | Group B Shipments | NS-only controlled items to Country Group B |
| CIV | Civil End-Users | NS-only items for civil end-use to Country Group D:1 |
| APP | Adjusted Peak Performance | Computers to specific country groups |
| TSR | Technology and Software Restriction | NS-only tech/software to Country Group B |
| TMP | Temporary Imports/Exports | Items exported temporarily, returned to US |
| RPL | Servicing and Replacement Parts | Replacement parts for previously licensed exports |

| ENC | Encryption | Mass-market encryption products/software |
| BAG | Baggage | Personal items in traveler's baggage |
| AVS | Aircraft and Vessels | Exports on aircraft/vessels |
| ACE | Additional Permissive Reexports | Reexports of certain controlled items |
| GFT | Gift Parcels | Personal gifts |

---

## Step 5 — End-User and End-Use Controls (Part 744)

### Restricted Party Lists

Always screen **all** parties (buyer, seller, broker, freight forwarder, bank, end-user, intermediate consignee) before every transaction.

| List | Effect | No License Exception |
|------|--------|----------------------|
| **Entity List** (Supplement 4, Part 744) | License required for all items subject to EAR | Generally no exceptions available |
| **Denied Persons List** (Part 764) | Absolute prohibition — no exports to/by these persons | All exceptions barred |
| **Unverified List** (Supplement 6, Part 744) | Cannot use any license exceptions; must obtain UVL Statement | All exceptions barred |
| **Military End-User (MEU) List** (Supplement 7, Part 744) | License required for items in Supplement 2, Part 744 | Most exceptions barred |
| **SDN List** (OFAC, not BIS) | Full block; not EAR but must screen alongside | N/A |

### Consolidated Screening List (CSL)
BIS, State, and Treasury lists are consolidated at **trade.gov/consolidated-screening-list** for single-search screening.

### WMD End-Use Prohibitions (§ 744.2–744.6)
No license exception applies when you know or have reason to know the item will be used in:
- Nuclear weapons development/production (§ 744.2)
- Missile systems (§ 744.3)
- Chemical/biological weapons (§ 744.4)
- Nuclear explosive activities (§ 744.5)
- Unsafeguarded nuclear activities (§ 744.6)

### Red Flag Indicators (§ 732.6)
BIS publishes "Red Flags" — indicators of suspicious orders. Stop the transaction and conduct due diligence if:
- Customer is reluctant to provide end-use information
- Item is incompatible with customer's stated business
- Payment from unusual third-country account
- Shipping route is circuitous or through unusual transhipment points
- Customer declines installation, training, or warranty

---

## Step 6 — Special Topics

### Deemed Exports (§ 734.13)
Releasing controlled **technology or software** to a **foreign national in the US** is deemed an export to their home country. Applies to:
- Visual inspection, hands-on access
- Oral briefings and demonstrations
- Electronic transmissions

> **Trigger:** A license is required if one would be required for the actual export of that technology/software to the foreign national's country of nationality.

### Foreign Direct Product Rule (FDPR) (§ 736.2(b)(3))
Foreign-made products are subject to EAR if they are the direct product of US-origin:
- Technology or software controlled for NS or CB reasons (General FDPR)
- Equipment controlled under ECCNs 3B001, 3B002, etc. used to fabricate semiconductors (Entity List FDPR — Huawei expansion 2020, advanced chip controls 2022/2023)

### De Minimis Rule (§ 734.4)
Foreign-made items incorporating US-controlled content are subject to EAR when the US content exceeds:
- **25%** of the fair market value — for items going to Country Group D:1 or E (most restricted)
- **10%** — for items designated AT-only or EAR99 going to embargoed countries

### US Person Controls (§ 744.6)
US persons — regardless of location — are prohibited from:
- Supporting foreign nuclear, missile, chemical/biological, or military-intelligence programs designated in § 744.6(c)
- Providing any support to parties on the Entity List for activities identified in their entry

---

## Step 7 — Licensing (Part 748)

- **Portal:** SNAP-R (Simplified Network Application Process Redesign) — snap-r.bis.doc.gov
- **No registration required** (unlike ITAR/DDTC)
- **Form BIS-748P** — Multipurpose Application Form for export licenses, CCATS, encryption reviews
- **Review timeline:** 9 of 10 applications decided within 90 days; interagency referrals possible
- **License conditions:** Read carefully; re-export authorizations, end-use statements, and reporting requirements may be attached
- **Advisory Opinions:** Informal guidance from BIS on whether a license is required (not binding)

---

## Step 8 — Recordkeeping (Part 762)

- Retain all export-related records for **5 years** from the date of export or reexport
- Records include: purchase orders, invoices, bills of lading, EEI filings, license applications, license exception documentation, denied party screening records
- Records must be made available to BIS inspectors on request
