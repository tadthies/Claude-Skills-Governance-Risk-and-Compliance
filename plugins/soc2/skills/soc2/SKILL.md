## Gap Analysis & Readiness Assessment

### Step 1 — Scope

Before assessing, confirm:
1. **Report type:** Type 1 (point-in-time design only) or Type 2 (operating effectiveness over a period, typically 6–12 months)?
2. **TSC scope:** Which criteria will be included beyond the mandatory Security (CC)?
3. **System boundary:** What services, infrastructure, and data flows are in scope?
4. **Timeline:** When is the target audit date?

### Step 2 — Self-Assessment Framework

For each in-scope criterion, assess:
- **Design:** Is a control designed and documented to meet this criterion?
- **Implementation:** Is the control actually in place and operating?
- **Evidence:** Can the organization prove it to an auditor?

Use this RAG status for each criterion:
- 🟢 **Met** — control is designed, implemented, and evidenced
- 🟡 **Partial** — control exists but has gaps (undocumented, inconsistently applied, missing evidence)
- 🔴 **Gap** — no control exists or is clearly insufficient

### Step 3 — Common Gaps by Area

See `references/controls.md` for per-criterion gap patterns. The most frequently flagged gaps across all organizations:

1. **Policies not documented or not reviewed annually** (hits CC1, CC2, CC5)
2. **No formal risk assessment process** (CC3)
3. **Access reviews not performed** (CC6)
4. **Incident response plan not tested** (CC7)
5. **Change management not consistently followed** (CC8)
6. **No vendor risk program** (CC9)
7. **Availability SLAs not monitored or evidenced** (A1)
8. **Data classification not defined** (C1, P3)
9. **Privacy notice incomplete or missing** (P1)

### Step 4 — Remediation Plan

For each 🔴 or 🟡 item, output a remediation plan entry:

```
Control Area: [TSC criterion, e.g., CC6.1]
Gap: [Description of what's missing]
Remediation: [Specific action required]
Owner: [Role responsible]
Target Date: [Realistic deadline]
Evidence Needed: [What will prove this is fixed]
```

## Policy & Procedure Writing

Read `references/policies.md` for full templates and writing guidance.

### Core Policy Set Required for SOC 2

| Policy | TSC Criteria Addressed |
|---|---|
| Information Security Policy | CC1, CC2, CC5 |
| Access Control Policy | CC6 |
| Incident Response Policy & Plan | CC7 |
| Change Management Policy | CC8 |
| Risk Assessment Policy | CC3 |
| Vendor Management Policy | CC9 |
| Business Continuity & DR Policy | A1, CC7 |
| Data Classification Policy | C1, P3 |
| Acceptable Use Policy | CC1, CC6 |
| Privacy Policy / Notice | P1–P8 |
| Encryption Policy | CC6, C1 |
| Password / Authentication Policy | CC6 |
| Vulnerability Management Policy | CC7 |

### Policy Writing Principles

1. **Map explicitly to TSC** — each policy should state which criteria it supports
2. **Assign ownership** — every policy needs a named owner/role
3. **Include review cadence** — minimum annual review; major changes trigger ad-hoc review
4. **Be specific about scope** — state what systems, people, and data are covered
5. **Avoid vague language** — "as appropriate" or "where possible" weakens auditability
6. **Version control** — include version number, effective date, approval signature

---

## Control Documentation

Read `references/controls.md` for the full control matrix template and per-criterion examples.

### Control Statement Format

Each control should be documented as:

```
Control ID:    [e.g., CC6.1-001]
TSC Criterion: [e.g., CC6.1 – Logical Access Controls]
Control Title: [Short descriptive name]
Control Type:  [Preventive / Detective / Corrective]
Control Owner: [Role]
Frequency:     [Continuous / Daily / Monthly / Annual / Event-driven]
Description:   [What the control does and how it works]
Evidence:      [What artifacts prove this control operates]
Test Procedure:[How an auditor would test this]
```

### Control Types to Know

- **Preventive** — stops a problem before it occurs (e.g., MFA, firewall rules)
- **Detective** — identifies a problem after it occurs (e.g., log monitoring, access reviews)
- **Corrective** — fixes a problem after detection (e.g., patch management, incident remediation)

Auditors expect a mix. Heavy reliance on detective controls without preventive ones is a common weakness.

## Audit Evidence Preparation

Read `references/evidence.md` for a full evidence catalog by criterion.

### Evidence Principles

1. **Contemporaneous** — evidence must be created at the time the control operates, not reconstructed retroactively
2. **Complete** — covers the full audit period (for Type 2)
3. **Attributable** — shows who performed the action and when
4. **Consistent** — demonstrates the control is repeatable, not a one-time event

### Evidence Organization

Organize evidence in folders mirroring criteria:
```
/audit-evidence/
  /CC1-control-environment/
  /CC2-communication/
  /CC3-risk-assessment/
  /CC4-monitoring/
  /CC5-control-activities/
  /CC6-access-controls/
  /CC7-system-operations/
  /CC8-change-management/
  /CC9-vendor-risk/
  /A1-availability/        (if in scope)
  /C1-confidentiality/     (if in scope)
  /PI1-processing-integrity/ (if in scope)
  /P1-P8-privacy/          (if in scope)
```

### Common Evidence Artifacts

| Control Area | Typical Evidence |
|---|---|
| Access control | User access list exports, provisioning tickets, access review sign-offs |
| Incident response | Incident tickets, IR runbooks, tabletop exercise records |
| Change management | Change request tickets, approval records, deployment logs |
| Risk assessment | Risk register, risk assessment document with sign-off |
| Vendor management | Vendor inventory, vendor assessments, contracts with security clauses |
| Monitoring | SIEM alerts/dashboards, vulnerability scan reports |
| Availability | Uptime dashboards, SLA reports, DR test results |
| Privacy | Privacy impact assessments, consent records, data subject request logs |

## Vendor Risk Questionnaires

Read `references/vendor.md` for full questionnaire templates and review guidance.

### When to Use (CC9 Context)

SOC 2 CC9 requires organizations to identify and manage risks from vendors and business partners.
This means:
- Maintaining a **vendor inventory** with risk tiering
- Performing **due diligence** before onboarding critical vendors
- **Reviewing** vendor SOC 2 reports (or equivalent) annually
- Addressing **Complementary User Entity Controls (CUECs)** from vendor SOC 2 reports

### Vendor Risk Tiers

| Tier | Criteria | Review Cadence |
|---|---|---|
| Critical | Access to production data or systems | Annual full assessment + SOC 2 report review |
| High | Process sensitive data on org's behalf | Annual questionnaire or SOC 2 review |
| Medium | Limited data access, operational dependency | Biannual questionnaire |
| Low | No data access, low operational risk | Lightweight onboarding check |

## Output Format Guidelines

Adapt your output to the user's context:

- **First-time / startup** — explain concepts, use plain language, provide examples, offer templates
- **Security/compliance team** — use technical TSC language, jump to specifics, provide gap matrices
- **Auditor/consultant** — use precise AICPA language, cite criteria codes, offer control testing procedures
- **Responding to a customer** — provide concise, professional summaries suitable for sharing externally

Always:
- Reference TSC criteria codes (e.g., CC6.1) when making specific claims
- Distinguish Type 1 vs Type 2 where relevant
- Flag when something requires a licensed CPA firm (formal audit, readiness letter)
- Note that controls must be tailored to the organization — SOC 2 prescribes criteria, not specific controls
