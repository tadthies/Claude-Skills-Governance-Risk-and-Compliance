## Core Concepts

### Critical Cyber Systems (CCS)
CCS are systems whose compromise or exploitation could result in:
- Operational disruption (inability to safely operate, monitor, or control physical assets)
- Safety impact (risk to employees, passengers, or the public)
- Environmental impact (uncontrolled release of hazardous materials)
- National security impact

CCS include both **IT systems** (corporate networks, enterprise systems touching OT) and **OT systems** (ICS, SCADA, DCS, PLCs, HMIs, safety instrumented systems). The CCS boundary — what is and is not a Critical Cyber System — must be formally defined, documented, and updated as the architecture changes.

**IT vs OT distinction:**
| Type | Examples | TSA Focus |
|------|---------|-----------|
| IT | Corporate email, ERP, HR, IT network | Segmentation from OT; access controls |
| OT | SCADA, DCS, PLCs, RTUs, HMIs, historians | Primary protection target; segmentation; monitoring |
| ICS | Industrial Control Systems (subset of OT) | Highest priority for network isolation |

### Cybersecurity Coordinator
All covered entities must designate a **Cybersecurity Coordinator** who:
- Is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week (or has a backup designee)
- Serves as the primary point of contact between the entity, TSA, and CISA
- Coordinates the entity's response to cybersecurity incidents
- Oversees implementation of the Cybersecurity Implementation Plan (CIP) / COIP
- Reports cybersecurity incidents to CISA within required timelines

### CISA vs TSA Roles
| Agency | Role |
|--------|------|
| **TSA** | Issues Security Directives; sets mandatory cybersecurity requirements; approves CIPs/COIPs/CAPs |
| **CISA** | Receives incident reports; provides threat intelligence; offers technical assistance; issues CPGs |

---

## Core Requirements (Applicable to All Covered Entities)

### 1. Cybersecurity Incident Reporting (Immediate)
**Requirement**: Report cybersecurity incidents to CISA within **24 hours** of identification.

**What must be reported**: Any cybersecurity incident that results in — or is reasonably likely to result in — operational disruption or unauthorised access to a CCS, including:
- Unauthorised access to IT or OT systems
- Discovery of malware or ransomware on CCS
- Denial of service affecting operational capability
- Phishing or social engineering with confirmed system access

**How to report**: Via CISA's 24/7 Operations Center: **1-888-282-0870** or **CISAgov@mail.dhs.gov**. TSA must also be notified.

**Do NOT delay reporting** while internal investigation is ongoing. Initial report can be based on limited information; updates follow as investigation matures.

### 2. Cybersecurity Coordinator Designation
**Requirement**: Designate a primary and backup Cybersecurity Coordinator within the timeline specified by the applicable directive.

**Coordinator duties**:
- Serve as 24/7 contact for TSA and CISA
- Coordinate implementation of cybersecurity measures
- Coordinate internal response to cybersecurity incidents
- Ensure incident reports are made to CISA within required timelines
- Maintain knowledge of the entity's CCS inventory

**Submission**: Coordinator contact information must be submitted to TSA via the designated TSA reporting system.

### 3. Review of Cybersecurity Practices (Gap Assessment)
**Requirement**: Conduct a review of current cybersecurity practices and identify any gaps. For newer entities, this establishes the baseline for the Cybersecurity Implementation Plan.

**Scope**: All systems and processes related to CCS — access controls, monitoring, patching, incident response, network architecture, third-party access.

## Cyber Risk Management Program (CRMP) — Core Requirements

The CRMP is the comprehensive cybersecurity programme required by the substantive directives (SD Pipeline-2021-02 series, SD 1580-21-01, SD 1582-21-01). It has four major components:

### Component 1: Cybersecurity Implementation Plan (CIP) / COIP
**What it is**: The governing document that describes how the entity will meet all CRMP requirements. Must be submitted to TSA for review and approval.

**Required CIP/COIP contents**:
- **Leadership structure**: Accountable Executive with C-suite authority; designated Cybersecurity Coordinator
- **CCS inventory**: Complete list of Critical Cyber Systems within scope
- **Network architecture description**: Current IT/OT architecture; segmentation mechanisms; communication flows
- **Baseline cybersecurity measures**: How each of the four technical domains (below) is addressed
- **Protective measures**: Access controls, monitoring, patching procedures
- **Incident detection procedures**: How anomalies and threats are identified
- **Incident response procedures**: How incidents are contained, remediated, and reported
- **Annual review process**: How the CIP is kept current

**CIP approval**: TSA reviews and either approves, requests modifications, or rejects. Entities cannot use unapproved CIPs as compliance evidence.

### Component 2: Incident Response Plan (IRP)
**What it is**: Documented procedures for detecting, responding to, and recovering from cybersecurity incidents affecting CCS.

**Required IRP elements**:
- Roles and responsibilities for incident response
- Detection and analysis procedures
- Containment, eradication, and recovery procedures
- Communication procedures (internal, CISA, TSA, leadership)
- Post-incident review process
- Coordination with third-party vendors and OT vendors

**Annual testing requirement**: Entities must **test at least two IRP objectives annually**. Testing objectives typically include:
- Isolating IT from OT (IT/OT segregation under incident conditions)
- Testing backup data integrity and restoration capability
- Verifying containment procedures for a simulated ransomware event
- Validating communication channels and escalation procedures

Retain evidence of testing (date, scenario, participants, findings, corrective actions).

### Component 3: Architecture Design Review (ADR)
**What it is**: An annual structured review of the entity's IT/OT network architecture to identify gaps, vulnerabilities, and segmentation deficiencies.

**ADR scope**:
- Review current network topology diagrams (must be current and accurate)
- Assess IT/OT segmentation effectiveness (firewalls, DMZs, data diodes, unidirectional gateways)
- Identify unauthorised or undocumented network connections to CCS
- Assess remote access paths into OT environments
- Evaluate third-party / vendor connectivity to CCS
- Document findings and remediation plan

**ADR outputs**: Updated network diagram; findings report; remediation action plan with timelines.

### Component 4: Cybersecurity Assessment Plan (CAP)
**What it is**: A formal plan documenting how the entity will assess the effectiveness of its CRMP annually.

**Required CAP elements**:
- Scope: which CCS and CRMP components are in scope for the assessment
- Assessment methodology: penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, configuration review, process review
- Assessment schedule: timeline for assessments during the year
- Responsible parties: internal or third-party assessors
- Reporting requirements: how results are reported to TSA

**Annual submission**: CAP results (findings, remediation status, open vulnerabilities) must be reported to TSA annually.

## Four Technical Security Domains

These are the specific technical cybersecurity measures required across all substantive TSA directives:

### Domain 1: Network Segmentation
Develop and implement **network segmentation policies and controls** to ensure the OT system can continue to safely operate if the IT system is compromised, and vice versa.

**Implementation requirements**:
- Formal network segmentation policy
- Documented and enforced IT/OT boundary (firewall rules, DMZ architecture, or physical separation)
- No direct routable connections between corporate IT and OT/ICS networks without security controls
- Remote access to OT must go through a demilitarised zone (DMZ) or jump server
- All segmentation exceptions documented with business justification

**Evidence for TSA/assessors**:
- Current and accurate network topology diagrams
- Firewall ruleset documentation
- Segmentation testing results (at least annually via IRP test or ADR)

### Domain 2: Access Controls
Implement measures to **secure and prevent unauthorised access to Critical Cyber Systems**.

**Implementation requirements**:
- Unique user accounts for all users; no shared accounts on CCS
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all remote access to CCS
- MFA for all privileged access to CCS (local and remote)
- Principle of least privilege for all CCS accounts
- Privileged Access Management (PAM) for OT administrator accounts
- Regular access reviews (at minimum annually)
- Vendor/third-party remote access via time-limited, monitored sessions
- Immediate revocation of access upon termination

**Evidence for TSA/assessors**:
- Access control policy; account inventory; PAM solution configuration
- MFA deployment evidence for remote and privileged access
- Access review records

### Domain 3: Continuous Monitoring and Detection
Build **continuous monitoring and detection policies and procedures** to detect cybersecurity threats and correct anomalies affecting CCS operations.

**Implementation requirements**:
- Network monitoring for OT environments (OT-aware IDS/IPS or network detection and response)
- Log collection and retention from CCS (both IT and OT where feasible)
- Baseline establishment for normal OT communications (protocol, frequency, endpoints)
- Anomaly detection for deviations from OT baseline
- Alerting and escalation procedures for detected anomalies
- Monitoring of remote access sessions to CCS
- Integration or escalation path to Security Operations Centre (SOC)

**OT-specific monitoring considerations**:
- Passive monitoring preferred for OT (active scanning can disrupt industrial protocols)
- OT-aware tools: Claroty, Dragos, Nozomi Networks, Armis, Microsoft Defender for IoT
- Focus on detecting: lateral movement, unusual protocol use, unauthorised devices, credential abuse

### Domain 4: Patch Management
Apply **security patches and updates** to operating systems, applications, drivers, and firmware on CCS in a timely manner using a **risk-based methodology**.

**Implementation requirements**:
- Formal patch management policy with defined patch SLAs
- Risk-based prioritisation: critical/high vulnerabilities patched faster than medium/low
- OT-specific process: vendor approval, testing in non-production environment before deployment
- Compensating controls for unpatchable legacy OT systems (network isolation, monitoring)
- Regular vulnerability scanning of CCS (both IT and OT-accessible)
- Exception process for patches requiring extended downtime (operational windows)

**OT patching realities**:
- Vendor approval required for many OT patches (to avoid voiding warranties/support)
- Patching windows may be limited to planned maintenance outages (quarterly, annual)
- Legacy PLC/RTU firmware may be unpatchable — compensating controls required

## Core Workflows

### 1. Applicability Determination
When asked whether an entity is covered by TSA directives:
1. Ask: What sector? (pipeline, freight rail, passenger rail/transit, bus, aviation)
2. Ask: Has TSA specifically notified/designated this entity as covered?
3. Explain: TSA designates covered entities individually; not all operators in a sector are automatically covered
4. Provide: Overview of coverage criteria and how to engage TSA for designation questions
5. Note: The 2024 NPRM proposes broader coverage — if finalised, more entities will be subject to mandatory requirements

### 2. Gap Assessment
When asked to assess compliance:
1. Ask: Which directive series applies? What sector? What revision is current for them?
2. Produce a table covering all four technical domains + CIP/COIP, IRP, ADR, CAP requirements
3. For each: **Status** (Compliant / Partial / Non-Compliant / N/A), **Gap Description**, **Evidence Required**
4. Highlight highest-risk gaps (no incident reporting process, no IT/OT segmentation, no Cybersecurity Coordinator)
5. Offer prioritised remediation roadmap

### 3. CIP / COIP Drafting
When asked to draft or review a CIP or COIP:
1. Ask: Which directive applies? Entity type and size? Existing architecture and tools?
2. Build the document following the required sections (see CRMP Component 1 above)
3. Ensure language is outcome-focused and maps to TSA review criteria
4. Flag sections requiring site-specific technical detail that cannot be generic
5. Note: CIP/COIP must be submitted to TSA for approval before use as compliance evidence

### 4. Incident Response Procedure
When asked about incident response requirements:
1. Provide the 24-hour CISA reporting requirement and contact information
2. Describe required IRP elements and annual testing obligations
3. Draft or review the IRP structure
4. Provide a step-by-step incident response playbook template aligned to TSA requirements

### 5. Policy Generation
When generating TSA-aligned policies:
- Always include: Purpose, Scope, Policy Statement, Roles & Responsibilities, Procedures, Review Cycle, TSA Directive references
- Map each policy to the specific TSA directive section it satisfies

**Common TSA-aligned policies**:
| Policy | Primary Directive Requirement |
|--------|------------------------------|
| Network Segmentation Policy | Domain 1 (all substantive directives) |
| Access Control Policy | Domain 2 (all substantive directives) |
| Privileged Access Management Policy | Domain 2 |
| Remote Access Policy (OT) | Domain 2 |
| Continuous Monitoring Policy | Domain 3 |
| Patch Management Policy (IT/OT) | Domain 4 |
| Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan | IRP requirement (all directives) |
| Vendor / Third-Party Access Policy | Domain 2; CRMP |
| Critical Cyber System Inventory Policy | CCS definition requirement |
| Change Management Policy (OT) | Domain 4; ADR |

## 2024 NPRM — What's Coming

In November 2024, TSA published a **Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM)** that would transition current Security Directive requirements into permanent federal regulations. Key aspects:

| Aspect | NPRM Proposal |
|--------|--------------|
| **Legal basis** | Formalises directives as regulation under 49 CFR |
| **Sectors covered** | Pipelines, freight railroad, passenger rail/transit (higher-risk); bus operators (incident reporting only) |
| **Core requirements** | Annual enterprise-wide cybersecurity evaluation; COIP; CAP |
| **Framework alignment** | Explicitly references NIST CSF 2.0 and CISA Cross-Sector CPGs |
| **Annual evaluation** | Compare entity's current profile vs target profile using NIST CSF |
| **Comment period** | Closed February 5, 2025 |
| **Final rule timeline** | Not yet published; directives remain in force until rule is finalised |

**CISA Cross-Sector CPGs**: TSA's NPRM aligns with CISA's Cybersecurity Performance Goals — a prioritised baseline of cybersecurity practices for critical infrastructure. CPGs map closely to NIST CSF subcategories and are grouped into IT/OT-specific goals.
