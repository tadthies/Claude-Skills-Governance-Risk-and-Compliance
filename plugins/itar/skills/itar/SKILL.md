## Core Workflows

### 1. Jurisdiction Determination (ITAR vs EAR)
When asked whether an item is ITAR- or EAR-controlled:

1. **Apply the USML enumeration test**: Is the item specifically described in any of the 21 USML categories (22 CFR § 121.1)?
2. **Apply the specially designed test** (22 CFR § 120.41): Was the item *specially designed* for military application and does it provide a critical military or intelligence advantage?
3. If neither test is met → item likely falls under EAR (Commerce Control List or EAR99)
4. If USML applies → identify the specific USML category and paragraph
5. Flag if a formal Commodity Jurisdiction (CJ) determination from DDTC may be needed

**Key principle**: ITAR is the more restrictive regime. When in doubt, treat as ITAR until a CJ confirms otherwise.

Reference USML categories → `references/usml-categories.md`

### 2. DDTC Registration
Who must register (22 CFR § 122.1):
- Any US person who **manufactures** defense articles, even if never exported
- Any US person who **exports or temporarily imports** defense articles or furnishes defense services
- Any US person who **brokers** defense articles or services (separate Part 129 registration)

**Registration process:**
1. Create account at the DDTC Registration Portal (registration.pmddtc.state.gov)
2. Submit DS-2032 (Statement of Registration) electronically
3. Pay annual fee (tiered by revenue: $2,750 for small businesses / $2,750–$27,500 for larger)
4. Renewal: annual, 60 days before expiration
5. Notify DDTC within 5 days of changes to registration details (22 CFR § 122.4)

**Registration does NOT authorise exports** — licenses or agreements are still required.

---

### 3. Export Licensing

**Common license types:**

| License | Form | Use Case |
|---------|------|----------|
| Permanent export | DSP-5 | Export of hardware to foreign end-user |
| Temporary export | DSP-73 | Equipment temporarily abroad (trade shows, repair) |
| Import certificate | DSP-94 | Temporary import of foreign defense articles |
| TAA | N/A (agreement) | Sharing technical data / providing defense services abroad |
| MLA | N/A (agreement) | Licensed manufacture of US defense articles abroad |

**DSP-5 application requirements:**
- Detailed item description and USML citation
- End-user identity and end-use statement
- Country of ultimate destination
- US government contract number (if applicable)
- Supporting documents: purchase order, end-user certificate (Form DV-1 or equivalent)

Reference licensing details → `references/licensing-guide.md`

### 4. Technical Assistance Agreements (TAA) and Manufacturing License Agreements (MLA)

**TAA** (22 CFR § 124.1): Authorises the export of **technical data** and/or **defense services** to a foreign person. Required before any sharing of ITAR-controlled technical data, training, or engineering support.

**MLA** (22 CFR § 124.2): Authorises a foreign person to **manufacture** a US defense article abroad, usually incorporating a sublicensing framework.

**Key TAA/MLA requirements:**
- Identify all parties (US licensor, foreign licensee, authorised sub-licensees)
- Define the scope of technical data / defense services precisely
- Include ITAR-required clauses: retransfer prohibition, US government access rights, record-keeping
- Submit via DDTC's D-Trade portal; approval takes 30–60 days
- Valid for 5 years; renewable
- Any amendment requires DDTC approval

---

### 5. Deemed Exports and Foreign National Access

A **deemed export** occurs when ITAR-controlled technical data is released to a foreign national inside the US — this is treated as an export to their home country (22 CFR § 120.50).

**Compliance steps for employers:**
1. Identify all foreign nationals with potential access to ITAR-controlled data/areas
2. Check country of citizenship (not just work authorisation status)
3. Verify no ITAR license is required for their home country
4. If required: obtain TAA or individual license before granting access
5. Maintain a **Technology Control Plan (TCP)**: physical access controls, IT access segregation, visitor procedures, annual training

**Exempt persons**: US persons (22 CFR § 120.62) include US citizens, lawful permanent residents, protected persons under 8 USC § 1324b — these do not require a deemed export license.

---

### 6. Brokering Regulations (22 CFR Part 129)

A **broker** is any person who facilitates the manufacture, export, import, transfer, re-export, sale, or other transfer of defense articles or services (22 CFR § 129.2).

**Obligations:**
- Separate DDTC registration as a broker (DS-2032, Part B)
- Prior approval required for transactions involving: embargoed countries, items valued >$1M, certain categories (Cats I, II, III, XI, XIII)
- Annual reports of all brokering activities (22 CFR § 129.10)
- Record retention: 5 years

---

### 7. Voluntary Disclosure and Violations

**Voluntary Self-Disclosure (VSD)** (22 CFR § 127.12):
1. Submit initial notification to DDTC (within ~30 days of discovering violation)
2. Conduct thorough internal investigation
3. Submit final VSD report: facts, violations, remediation steps, corrective actions
4. Cooperation and remediation are significant mitigating factors
5. May result in no penalty, warning letter, or reduced civil penalty

**Civil penalties**: Up to $1,369,000 per violation (adjusted annually per FCPIA)
**Criminal penalties**: Up to $1,000,000 fine and 20 years imprisonment per violation (22 USC § 2778)
**Debarment**: DDTC may debar a company from ITAR privileges for serious/repeated violations

**Aggravating factors**: wilfulness, harm to national security, senior management involvement, prior violations
**Mitigating factors**: VSD, cooperation, effective compliance programme, no prior history

Reference full penalty framework → `references/compliance-program.md`

---

### 8. Technology Control Plan (TCP)

A TCP is an internal policy document demonstrating how a company controls access to ITAR-controlled technical data, especially regarding foreign nationals. Key sections:

1. **Scope**: Which programs/data are ITAR-controlled
2. **Access controls**: Who is authorised; physical and logical segregation
3. **Foreign national procedures**: Screening, TAA requirements, visitor log
4. **Training**: Annual ITAR training records
5. **Incident response**: How violations are identified and reported
6. **Records**: 5-year retention for all export records (22 CFR § 122.5)

---

## Embargoed and Restricted Countries

**Comprehensive arms embargoes** (22 CFR § 126.1) — no ITAR exports without presidential waiver:
- Belarus, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Russia, Syria, Venezuela (restricted)

Always check the current 22 CFR § 126.1 list and OFAC sanctions before any transaction.
