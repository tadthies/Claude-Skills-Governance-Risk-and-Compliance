## LGPD Structure Overview

### Scope (Art. 3)
LGPD applies to **any** processing of personal data of individuals located in Brazil, regardless of where the controller/processor is established, when:
- Processing occurs in Brazil
- Purpose is to offer goods/services to individuals in Brazil

| **Adequacy** | Compatible with declared purposes |
| **Necessity** | Minimum data necessary for the purpose |
| **Free access** | Data subjects can consult their data freely |
| **Quality** | Data must be accurate, clear, relevant, up to date |
| **Transparency** | Clear, accurate, easily accessible information |
| **Security** | Technical and administrative measures to protect data |
| **Prevention** | Adopt measures to prevent harm before it occurs |

## Legal Bases for Processing

### Regular Personal Data (Art. 7) — 10 bases

| # | Legal Basis | Key Requirements |
|---|------------|-----------------|
| I | **Consent** | Free, informed, unambiguous; specific purpose; easy withdrawal |
| II | **Legal obligation** | Processing required by law or regulation |
| III | **Public policy execution** | By public entities for public administration |
| IV | **Research** | Studies by research bodies; anonymisation preferred |

---

## Controller & Processor Obligations

### Controller Obligations
- Maintain **Records of Processing Activities (RoPA)** — Art. 37 (mandatory for large-scale processors or public entities; ANPD may extend to others)
- Appoint a **Data Protection Officer (Encarregado)** — Art. 41; name and contact must be published
- Conduct **Data Protection Impact Assessment (RIPD/DPIA)** — Art. 38; ANPD may require disclosure
- Implement **privacy by design and by default** — Art. 46, §2º
- Report security incidents to ANPD and affected data subjects — Art. 48

### Processor (Operador) Obligations

- Jointly liable if violates LGPD or fails to follow controller instructions — Art. 42, §1º

### Joint Controllership
- Where two or more controllers jointly determine purposes/means — each jointly liable — Art. 42

---

## Consent Requirements (Art. 8)

Valid LGPD consent must be:
- **Free** — no coercion or conditioning to service (unless necessary)
- **Informed** — purpose clearly stated
- **Unambiguous** — affirmative action; pre-ticked boxes invalid
- **Specific** — per purpose; bundled consent for unrelated purposes invalid
- **Documented** — burden of proof on controller
- **Revocable** — at any time, at no cost, without prejudice

**Consent for sensitive data (Art. 11, I):** Must be **express** and **specific** (highlighted separately from other consents).

---

## International Data Transfers (Art. 33–36)

> ⚠️ **Major 2026 Update — Brazil-EU Mutual Adequacy:** On **January 26–27, 2026**, Brazil and the European Union established **mutual adequacy recognition**: the European Commission adopted an adequacy decision for Brazil under GDPR Article 45, and Brazil's ANPD simultaneously recognized the EU as an adequate transfer destination. **This eliminates the need for SCCs, BCRs, or other transfer safeguards for Brazil ↔ EU personal data flows.** Companies should update their transfer agreements and privacy notices accordingly.

Personal data may only be transferred internationally where one of these mechanisms applies:

| Mechanism | Description | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| **Adequacy decision** | ANPD recognised country/organisation as providing adequate protection | **EU/EEA: adequate as of January 2026. No SCCs or BCRs needed for Brazil→EU transfers.** |
| **Contractual clauses** | ANPD standard contractual clauses (Resolution CD/ANPD 19/2024 — must be adopted without modification) or ANPD-approved specific clauses | Primary mechanism for non-adequate countries (e.g., US, China) |
| **Global corporate standards** | Binding corporate rules (BCRs) | Intragroup transfers to non-adequate countries |
| **Specific consent** | Data subject explicitly consented, informed of international transfer | Consent must be specific to the transfer |
| **Legal cooperation** | Between public entities for treaty obligations | Government data sharing |
| **Vital interests** | Protection of data subject's life | Emergency situations only |
| **ANPD authorisation** | Case-by-case ANPD approval | For transfers not covered by other mechanisms |

**Impact of Brazil-EU adequacy for compliance teams:**
- Remove SCCs/BCRs from Brazil→EU or EU→Brazil transfer agreements and replace with adequacy reference
- Update privacy notices and RoPA to reflect adequacy-based transfer mechanism for EU recipients
- Retain other safeguards for transfers to the US, UK, China, or other non-adequate countries
- Monitor ANPD adequacy list (expected to grow) at anpd.gov.br

---

## Security & Incident Response (Art. 46–48)

### Security Measures (Art. 46)
Controllers and processors must adopt technical and administrative measures to protect data from:
- Unauthorised access
- Accidental/unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, or disclosure

ANPD may issue minimum security standards. Controllers bear responsibility for processor security.

### Breach Notification (Art. 48)
Controllers must notify ANPD and data subjects when a security incident may cause **relevant risk or harm**:
- **Timeframe:** ANPD Resolution CD/ANPD No. 15/2024 sets **3 working days** for preliminary notification
- **Content:** Nature of affected data, data subjects concerned, technical/security measures, risks, measures taken/planned
- **Full report:** Within **20 working days** of confirmation

---

## ANPD Enforcement & Penalties (Art. 52–54)

| Sanction | Details |
|----------|---------|
| Warning | With period to remedy |
| Simple fine | Up to **2% of revenue** in Brazil (previous FY, group); max **R$50 million per violation** |
| Daily fine | To compel compliance; same cap |
| Publicisation | Public disclosure of infraction after investigation |
| Blocking | Temporary blocking of personal data related to violation |
| Deletion | Deletion of personal data related to violation |
| Suspension | Partial suspension of processing for up to 6 months (extendable) |
| Prohibition | Complete ban on personal data processing activities |

## Workflows

### 1. Legal Basis Determination
1. Identify type of data (regular vs. sensitive vs. children's)
2. For sensitive data → apply Art. 11 bases exclusively
3. For crianças (<12) → specific parental/guardian consent required (Art. 14, §1º); for adolescents (12–17) → processing must observe their best interest (Art. 14 caput; ANPD Enunciado 1/2023)
4. Map each processing activity to one Art. 7 basis
5. Document basis in RoPA and privacy notice
6. If using legitimate interest → conduct balancing test; document

### 2. LGPD Gap Assessment
1. Map all personal data flows (collection → processing → storage → sharing → deletion)
2. Assess each processing activity against Art. 6 principles and Art. 7/11 bases
3. Evaluate data subject rights fulfilment capability (Art. 17–22)
4. Review DPO appointment and DPO publication (Art. 41)
5. Check RoPA existence and completeness (Art. 37)
6. Review privacy notices for Art. 9 elements
7. Assess security measures (Art. 46)
8. Review international transfer mechanisms (Art. 33–36) — **note: EU transfers now covered by adequacy (Jan 2026)**
9. Evaluate breach response readiness (Art. 48)
10. Produce gap table with priority ratings

### 3. Privacy Notice Drafting (Art. 9)
Required elements:
- Identity/contact of controller
- DPO contact
- Purpose of processing
- Legal basis
- Data subjects' rights and how to exercise them
- Whether data will be shared and with whom
- International transfers (and mechanism — adequacy for EU, SCCs for US/others)
- Retention period
- Any profiling/automated decisions

### 4. Data Subject Request Handling
1. Verify identity of requestor
2. Identify request type (Art. 18)
3. Check if exemption applies (Art. 18, §3º, §4º)
4. Locate all data within systems
5. Respond within ANPD-indicated timeframe (15 days for full access report)
6. Log request and response for accountability

### 5. Breach Response
1. **Detect & Contain** — isolate systems, preserve evidence
2. **Assess** — determine data types affected, number of subjects, risk level
3. **3-working-day preliminary ANPD notification** (if relevant risk)
4. **Notify data subjects** where high risk of harm
5. **20-working-day full report** to ANPD
6. **Remediate** — implement corrective measures
7. **Document** — complete incident record for accountability

### 6. LGPD vs. GDPR Comparison (key differences)
| Topic | LGPD | GDPR |
|-------|------|------|
| Legal bases | 10 bases (Art. 7); includes credit protection | 6 bases (Art. 6 GDPR) |
| DPO | "Encarregado" required for controllers; ANPD Res. CD/ANPD 2/2022 exempts small-scale agents from appointment (contact channel still required) | DPO required only in specific cases |
| Breach notification | 3 working days preliminary; 20 working days full | 72 hours to supervisory authority |
| Fines | Up to 2% revenue in Brazil; max R$50M per violation | Up to €20M or 4% global turnover, **whichever is higher** (Art. 83(5)) |
| Adequacy | **EU/EEA adequate as of January 2026**; ANPD list growing | EC decides; Brazil adequate as of January 2026 |
| Children | Parental consent for crianças (<12, Art. 14 §1º); adolescents (12–17) processed in their best interest | Parental consent <16 for information society services (member state may lower to 13) |
