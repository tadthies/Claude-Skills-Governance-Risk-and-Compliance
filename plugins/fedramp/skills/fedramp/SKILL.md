## Current FedRAMP State (as of July 2026 — CR26)

> ⚠️ **CR26 (Certification Reform 2026)**: FedRAMP has restructured its authorization framework. FIPS 199-based impact levels (Low/Moderate/High/LI-SaaS) are being replaced with **Certification Classes A–D**. CSPs already authorized under the old model retain their ATO while transition timelines are confirmed by the FedRAMP PMO.

- **Baseline**: NIST SP 800-53 **Rev 5** (fully in effect)
- **Control counts** (Rev 5): Low ≈ 156, Moderate = 323, High = 421 (legacy references; CR26 class-based counts being published by PMO)
- **CR26 Certification Classes**: A (basic/low-impact), B (standard/moderate-impact), C (enhanced/high-impact), D (specialized/critical). The PMO is publishing updated control baselines aligned to each class.
- **FedRAMP 20x**: Now the **primary authorization pathway** — continuous authorization, modular API-driven submissions, automated evidence collection. Traditional SSP/SAP/SAR templates remain for legacy paths.
- **FedRAMP Ready** designation: **Retires July 28, 2026**. CSPs currently in FedRAMP Ready status must transition to FedRAMP 20x or initiate a full authorization package. No new FedRAMP Ready designations are being issued.
- **JAB P-ATO**: Fully suspended; FedRAMP PMO is the sole authorization body.
- **OSCAL mandate**: RFC-0024 requires all CSPs to submit machine-readable OSCAL packages by **September 30, 2026**.
- **Security Inbox**: All authorized CSPs must maintain a dedicated Security Inbox (no CAPTCHAs or barriers) for urgent vulnerability directives — effective January 5, 2026.
- **Key templates updated**: SSP, SAR, SAP, POA&M, CIS/CRM, IIW, ISCP — all updated to align with Rev 5 (Dec 2024 releases).

## 1. Readiness & Gap Assessment

### Approach
1. **Clarify scope** — Ask the user: What is the CSO (Cloud Service Offering)? IaaS/PaaS/SaaS? Target Certification Class under CR26?
2. **Identify authorization path** — FedRAMP 20x (primary, preferred) vs. legacy Agency Authorization package (still available for complex systems during CR26 transition)
3. **Run through the readiness checklist** — See `references/readiness-checklist.md`
4. **Surface gaps** — Map current state to required controls; flag missing documentation, unimplemented controls, and architectural deficiencies
5. **Prioritize** — Group gaps by: (a) blockers for readiness review, (b) items addressable before 3PAO assessment, (c) POA&M candidates

> **FedRAMP Ready is retiring July 28, 2026.** If a CSP is currently pursuing FedRAMP Ready, advise them to pivot immediately to FedRAMP 20x or begin a full authorization package.

### Key Readiness Questions to Ask the User
- Are you targeting FedRAMP 20x (preferred) or a legacy authorization package?
- What cloud platform (AWS GovCloud, Azure Government, GCP, on-prem hybrid)?
- Are you leveraging any existing FedRAMP-authorized IaaS/PaaS (e.g., AWS GovCloud FedRAMP High)?
- Do you have FIPS 140-2/3 validated encryption in place?
- Is your authorization boundary defined and documented?
- Do you have a vulnerability scanning program (OS, DB, web app, container)?
- Are security policies and procedures documented?
- Do you have an Incident Response Plan (IRP) and Contingency Plan (CP) that have been tested?
- Are your authorization package artifacts in OSCAL format (mandatory by September 30, 2026)?

### Output Format
- Produce a **gap table**: Control Family | Current State | Gap | Priority | Owner
- Summarize top 5–10 high-priority gaps as prose
- Note the target Certification Class and whether FedRAMP 20x is feasible

## 2. ATO Documentation

The core FedRAMP authorization package consists of:

```
Authorization Package
├── System Security Plan (SSP) + Appendices A–Q
├── Security Assessment Plan (SAP) + Appendices A–D  [3PAO-prepared]
├── Security Assessment Report (SAR) + Appendices A–F  [3PAO-prepared]
└── Plan of Action & Milestones (POA&M)  [SSP Appendix O]
```

> **Important**: CSPs must use official FedRAMP PMO templates. OSCAL-format submissions are mandatory by September 30, 2026.
> Templates: https://www.fedramp.gov/documents-templates/

### Document Guidance

For detailed guidance on each document type, read the appropriate reference file:

- **SSP** → `references/ssp-guide.md`
- **POA&M** → `references/poam-guide.md`
- **SAP / SAR** → `references/sap-sar-guide.md`
- **Supporting appendices** → `references/appendices-guide.md`

### General Writing Principles for All ATO Docs
1. **Describe only what is implemented** — Do not document planned or aspirational controls; these trigger findings and must go in POA&M instead
2. **Be specific** — Reference exact tools, filenames, section numbers, policy names; vague language causes findings
3. **Mind the verbs** — Each control requirement uses specific verbs (track, document, enforce, test). Address each verb explicitly
4. **Shared responsibility** — For any customer-configurable or shared control, create a clear "Customer Responsibility" section
5. **Keep it consistent** — Architecture diagrams, data flows, inventory, and control statements must all be internally consistent

## 3. NIST 800-53 Control Mapping

### Control Families (Rev 5)

| ID | Family | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| AC | Access Control | IAM, RBAC, least privilege, remote access |
| AT | Awareness & Training | Security + **privacy** training (new in Rev 5) |
| AU | Audit & Accountability | Log retention, SIEM, audit review |
| CA | Assessment, Authorization & Monitoring | ConMon, 3PAO, ATO |
| CM | Configuration Management | Baselines, change control, CMDB |
| CP | Contingency Planning | BCP/DR, tested annually |
| IA | Identification & Authentication | MFA, PIV, FIPS 140-2/3 crypto |
| IR | Incident Response | IRP, tested annually, reporting SLAs |
| MA | Maintenance | Remote maintenance controls |
| MP | Media Protection | Data at rest, media sanitization |
| PE | Physical & Environmental | Datacenters; often inherited from IaaS |
| PL | Planning | SSP, rules of behavior |
| PM | Program Management | Enterprise-level security program |
| PS | Personnel Security | Screening, termination procedures |
| PT | PII Processing & Transparency | **New family in Rev 5** — privacy controls |
| RA | Risk Assessment | Vulnerability scanning, MITRE ATT&CK scoring |
| SA | System & Services Acquisition | SDLC, supply chain |
| SC | System & Communications Protection | Encryption in transit, network segmentation |
| SI | System & Information Integrity | Patching, malware, integrity monitoring |
| SR | Supply Chain Risk Management | **New family in Rev 5** — SCRM |

### CR26 Certification Class Mapping

Under CR26, the FedRAMP PMO is aligning control baselines to Certification Classes. When users describe their system, map to a class:

- **Class A** (Basic): Cloud-native, low federal data sensitivity; limited scope; aligned to old Low-impact tier
- **Class B** (Standard): Most common — federal information with serious adverse effect if compromised; aligned to old Moderate-impact tier; covers the majority of CSPs handling non-classified government data
- **Class C** (Enhanced): Federal information where compromise has severe or catastrophic effect (law enforcement, financial, health data); aligned to old High-impact tier
- **Class D** (Specialized): Critical/ultra-sensitive systems; new category with additional requirements

> **Legacy references**: Many existing FedRAMP documents still reference Low/Moderate/High/LI-SaaS. These map to Classes A/B/C respectively. A full CR26 class-to-control baseline mapping is being published by the PMO — advise CSPs to check fedramp.gov for the latest.

### Mapping Workflow
1. Ask: What types of federal data will the system process/store/transmit?
2. Determine target Certification Class (A, B, C, or D) under CR26
3. Select NIST 800-53 Rev 5 baseline (Low/Moderate/High as proxy until CR26 baselines are final)
4. Cross-reference with FedRAMP parameter requirements (FedRAMP often sets stricter parameters than base NIST)
5. For inherited controls, identify which are fully/partially inherited from leveraged FedRAMP IaaS/PaaS and document in CIS/CRM workbook

### Rev 4 → Rev 5 Key Changes to Highlight
- **New control families**: PT (Privacy), SR (Supply Chain)
- **Password controls revised**: No more forced rotation schedules; requires compromised-password lists and password strength meters (NIST 800-63b alignment)
- **Privacy integrated**: AT-3 now mandates privacy training; many families have privacy-specific enhancements
- **Threat-based methodology**: MITRE ATT&CK framework informs control prioritization

## 4. Architecture Guidance

### Authorization Boundary
The boundary defines what is IN scope for FedRAMP. This is one of the most common sources of findings and delays.

Key principles:
- **Everything that processes, stores, or transmits federal data** must be inside the boundary
- External services connected to in-scope systems must be FedRAMP-authorized OR documented with compensating controls
- Boundary must be depicted in a clear **network/data flow diagram** (required in SSP)

### Cloud Platform Considerations

**AWS GovCloud (US)**
- AWS GovCloud is FedRAMP High authorized — most PE and some SC controls are fully inherited
- Use AWS Config, CloudTrail, GuardDuty, Security Hub to satisfy AU, RA, SI controls
- Ensure use of GovCloud region endpoints (not standard commercial) to stay in boundary
- FIPS endpoints available for IA controls

**Azure Government**
- Azure Government is FedRAMP High authorized
- Azure Policy + Defender for Cloud maps well to CM, RA, SI
- Use Azure Blueprints / Policy Initiatives aligned to FedRAMP Moderate/High

**Google Cloud (FedRAMP-authorized regions)**
- Assured Workloads for FedRAMP compliance
- Chronicle SIEM for AU controls

### Architecture Patterns That Support FedRAMP
- **Zero Trust** — aligns directly with AC, IA, SC control families
- **Immutable infrastructure** — simplifies CM (configuration drift is a common finding)
- **Centralized logging** — SIEM/log aggregation addresses AU family comprehensively
- **Automated vulnerability scanning** — Required; must cover OS, DB, web app, and containers (if used)
- **OSCAL-native tooling** — Invest now; OSCAL submission is mandatory September 30, 2026

### Common Architecture Findings
- Undocumented external connections leaving the boundary
- FIPS-non-compliant encryption algorithms in transit or at rest
- Overly broad IAM roles / lack of least privilege
- Missing MFA on privileged accounts
- Vulnerability scans not covering all boundary components
- Logging gaps (not all components sending logs to centralized SIEM)
- Authorization packages not in OSCAL format ahead of September 2026 mandate

## 5. Continuous Monitoring

Once authorized, CSPs must maintain compliance through ConMon activities:

### Monthly Requirements
- Vulnerability scan results submitted to agency AOs
- POA&M updates (open findings, remediation progress)
- Inventory updates (new/removed assets)
- ConMon Monthly Executive Summary (template updated Nov 2024)

### Annual Requirements
- Full security assessment by 3PAO using Annual Assessment Controls Selection Worksheet
- Updated SSP and appendices
- Tested IRP and CP
- SAR and updated POA&M

### POA&M Management
- All open findings must have: risk level, owner, milestone dates, remediation plan
- Vendor Dependencies (VDs): when a finding depends on a third-party fix — document and track
- Deviation Requests (DRs): false positives and risk adjustments require AO approval
- SLA for remediation: **Critical = 15 days**, **High = 30 days**, Moderate = 90 days, Low = 365 days (FedRAMP PMO published timeframes)
