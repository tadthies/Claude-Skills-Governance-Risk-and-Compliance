## PCI DSS Structure — 12 Requirements and 6 Goals

PCI DSS v4.0.1 organises its 12 requirements under 6 overarching goals:

| Goal | Requirements | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Build and Maintain a Secure Network and Systems** | 1, 2 | Network security controls; secure configurations |
| **Protect Account Data** | 3, 4 | Stored account data protection; data in transit encryption |
| **Maintain a Vulnerability Management Program** | 5, 6 | Anti-malware; secure development |
| **Implement Strong Access Control Measures** | 7, 8, 9 | Need-to-know access; authentication; physical access |
| **Regularly Monitor and Test Networks** | 10, 11 | Logging and monitoring; security testing |
| **Maintain an Information Security Policy** | 12 | Organizational policy and programs |

Consult `references/pci-dss-requirements.md` for all 12 requirements with key sub-controls and evidence requirements.

## Core Concepts

### Cardholder Data Environment (CDE)
The CDE is the system components, people, and processes that store, process, or transmit **cardholder data (CHD)** or **sensitive authentication data (SAD)**, plus any system that can impact their security.

**Account data types:**
- **PAN** (Primary Account Number) — the card number; the core element that triggers PCI DSS scope
- **Cardholder Name, Expiry Date, Service Code** — CHD; can be stored if protected
- **SAD** (Full magnetic stripe/chip data, CVV/CVC, PINs) — **must never be stored after authorisation**

**Scope reduction strategies:**
- **Tokenisation** — replace PAN with a token; removes tokenised systems from CDE scope
- **Point-to-Point Encryption (P2PE)** — validated P2PE solutions can dramatically reduce scope
- **Network segmentation** — isolate the CDE from out-of-scope networks (not required but strongly recommended)

### Merchant Levels and Validation Requirements

**Merchants:**
| Level | Transactions/Year | Validation Requirement |
|-------|------------------|----------------------|
| Level 1 | >6 million Visa/MC transactions, or any that suffered a breach | Annual ROC by QSA + quarterly ASV scan |
| Level 2 | 1–6 million Visa/MC transactions | Annual SAQ + quarterly ASV scan |
| Level 3 | 20,000–1 million Visa e-commerce transactions | Annual SAQ + quarterly ASV scan |
| Level 4 | <20,000 Visa e-commerce OR up to 1 million other Visa | Annual SAQ recommended + quarterly ASV scan |

**Service Providers:**
| Level | Criteria | Validation |
|-------|---------|------------|
| Level 1 | >300,000 transactions/year OR designated by card brands | Annual ROC by QSA + quarterly ASV scan |
| Level 2 | ≤300,000 transactions/year | Annual SAQ-D for Service Providers + quarterly ASV scan |

### Defined Approach vs Customised Approach (New in v4.0)

| Approach | Description | Best For |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Defined Approach** | Follow prescriptive requirements as written | Most organisations; standard controls |
| **Customised Approach** | Implement alternative controls that meet the stated Objective | Mature organisations with innovative security practices |

The Customised Approach requires a **Targeted Risk Analysis (TRA)** for each customised control, approved by senior management, and assessed by a QSA.

## SAQ Selection Guide

Consult `references/pci-dss-saq-guide.md` for the full SAQ selection decision tree and per-SAQ control counts.

**Quick reference:**
| SAQ | Applies To | ~Controls |
|-----|-----------|----------|
| **A** | Card-not-present merchants; all CHD functions fully outsourced to PCI-compliant third parties | ~22 |
| **A-EP** | E-commerce merchants; outsource payment processing but control how customers redirect to third party | ~191 |
| **B** | Merchants using only imprint machines or standalone dial-out terminals; no e-commerce | ~41 |
| **B-IP** | Merchants using standalone IP-connected PTS POI devices only; no e-commerce | ~83 |
| **C** | Merchants with payment application systems connected to internet; no e-commerce | ~160 |
| **C-VT** | Merchants using web-based virtual terminals on isolated device; no e-commerce | ~90 |
| **P2PE** | Merchants using validated P2PE solution only; no e-commerce | ~33 |
| **D (Merchant)** | All other merchants not covered above | ~340 |
| **D (Service Provider)** | All service providers eligible for SAQ | ~340 |

## Core Workflows

### 1. CDE Scoping
When asked to help scope the CDE:
1. Ask: What data flows involve PANs? (intake, processing, storage, transmission channels)
2. Identify all system components that store, process, or transmit CHD/SAD
3. Identify connected systems that could impact CDE security (jump hosts, monitoring, AD)
4. Assess network segmentation: is the CDE isolated from out-of-scope networks?
5. Identify scope reduction opportunities (tokenisation, P2PE, outsourcing)
6. Produce: In-scope system inventory, data flow description, segmentation assessment, scope reduction recommendations

**Scoping rules:**
- Any system that stores/processes/transmits PAN → in scope
- Any system connected to a CDE system without adequate segmentation → in scope
- Cloud components that touch CHD (even briefly) → in scope
- Third-party service providers that could impact CDE security → must be PCI-compliant

### 2. Gap Assessment
When asked to assess compliance against PCI DSS v4.0.1:
1. Ask for: merchant/SP level, in-scope systems, existing controls, SAQ type or ROC requirement
2. Produce a table for each of the 12 requirements with sub-controls
3. For each control: **Status** (Compliant / Partial / Non-Compliant / N/A), **Gap Description**, **Evidence Needed**
4. Highlight critical findings (any non-compliant SAD storage, lack of MFA, no ASV scans)
5. Offer remediation roadmap

**Status definitions:**
- ✅ Compliant — control is fully in place and operating effectively with evidence
- 🟡 Partial — some controls exist but gaps, exceptions, or inconsistencies remain
- ❌ Non-Compliant — control not implemented; compensating control or remediation required
- N/A — not applicable to this environment with documented justification

### 3. SAQ Selection
When asked which SAQ applies:
1. Ask: Merchant or service provider? How are card transactions accepted? (card-present, CNP, e-commerce, MOTO)
2. Ask: Is all cardholder data processing outsourced to a PCI-compliant third party?
3. Ask: Are P2PE validated devices used exclusively?
4. Ask: Is there any card-present processing?
5. Walk through the decision logic to select the correct SAQ type
6. Explain what controls the selected SAQ covers and what is excluded from scope

### 4. Control Implementation Guidance
For any PCI DSS requirement or sub-control, structure your response as:

**Requirement [X.X]: [Name]**
- **What it requires**: Plain-language description
- **How to implement**: Concrete, actionable steps
- **Evidence for QSA**: What a QSA or ISA will look for during assessment
- **Common gaps**: What organisations typically miss or get wrong
- **v4.0 note** (if changed from v3.2.1): What is new or different

### 5. Policy Generation
When generating PCI DSS-aligned policies:
- Include: Purpose, Scope, Policy Statement, Roles & Responsibilities, Standards/Procedures, Review Cycle, PCI DSS Requirement references
- Include document control block: Version | Author | Approved By | Date | Next Review

**Common PCI-aligned policies:**
| Policy | Primary Requirement(s) |
|--------|----------------------|
| Network Security Control Policy | Req 1 |
| System Configuration/Hardening Policy | Req 2 |
| Data Retention and Disposal Policy | Req 3 |
| Cryptography and Key Management Policy | Req 3.5, 4 |
| Vulnerability Management Policy | Req 5, 6 |
| Secure Development Policy (SDLC) | Req 6 |
| Access Control Policy | Req 7 |
| User Authentication and Password Policy | Req 8 |
| Physical Security Policy | Req 9 |
| Audit Log Management Policy | Req 10 |
| Penetration Testing and ASV Scan Policy | Req 11 |
| Information Security Policy | Req 12 |
| Incident Response Plan | Req 12.10 |

## Compensating Controls

When a requirement cannot be met due to a technical or business constraint, organisations may implement a **Compensating Control** (Defined Approach only). Requirements:
1. Must meet the intent and rigour of the original requirement
2. Must go above and beyond other PCI DSS requirements
3. Must be commensurate with the additional risk from not meeting the requirement
4. Must be documented in the ROC/SAQ with a Compensating Control Worksheet (CCW)

Compensating controls are **not available** under the Customised Approach — the TRA process serves a similar function there.
