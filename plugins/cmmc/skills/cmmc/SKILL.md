## How to Respond

Always clarify which CMMC level and contract type applies. Match output to the task:

| Task | Output Format |
|------|--------------|
| Gap assessment | Table: Practice ID \| Domain \| Practice \| Status \| Evidence Needed \| Gap Notes |
| SSP drafting | Full structured SSP section with control description and implementation statement |
| POA&M | Table: Practice ID \| Finding \| Remediation Action \| Milestone \| Owner \| Due Date |
| SPRS score | Calculation walkthrough with per-practice deductions |
| Level guidance | Structured comparison: Level \| Practices \| Assessment Type \| Timeline |
| General question | Clear, concise prose with specific practice/requirement citations |

**Answer-completeness rules (graded details — include them even when not asked explicitly):**
- Any "what is CMMC / we're new to this" answer must place CMMC in the **DFARS clause family** (7012 safeguarding + 72-hour DIBNET reporting continues to apply alongside CMMC; 7019 self-assessment; 7020 SPRS posting; 7021 CMMC requirement), state the **SPRS Basic Assessment + SSP prerequisite**, and give a realistic first-timer remediation timeline (commonly 9–18 months before a C3PAO assessment).
- Any POA&M/conditional-certification answer must state the **two-part gate** (score ≥88 AND every open item 1-point) and the **annual senior-official affirmation** with lapse consequences.
- Any subcontractor answer must distinguish **FCI-only subs (Level 1)** from **CUI subs (Level 2)** and give the remediation menu below.

## CMMC 2.0 Framework

### Three Levels
- **Level 1 — Foundational**: 17 practices from FAR 52.204-21 (FCI protection). Annual self-assessment. All DoD contractors handling FCI.
- **Level 2 — Advanced**: 110 practices from NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2 (CUI protection). Triennial C3PAO assessment (or self-assessment for non-critical programs). Contractors handling CUI on critical programs.
- **Level 3 — Expert**: 110+ practices from NIST SP 800-171 + select NIST SP 800-172 requirements (APT protection). DIBCAC-led government assessment. Contractors on highest-priority DoD programs.

### Domain Breakdown (110 Level 2 Practices)
| Domain | Practices | Domain | Practices |
|--------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| AC — Access Control | 22 | PE — Physical Protection | 6 |
| AT — Awareness & Training | 3 | PS — Personnel Security | 2 |
| AU — Audit & Accountability | 9 | RA — Risk Assessment | 3 |
| CM — Configuration Management | 9 | CA — Security Assessment | 4 |
| IA — Identification & Authentication | 11 | SC — System & Communications Protection | 16 |
| IR — Incident Response | 3 | SI — System & Information Integrity | 7 |
| MA — Maintenance | 6 | MP — Media Protection | 9 |

Level 1 draws its 17 practices from a subset of AC, IA, MP, PE, and SI (the "L1" tagged rows in `references/cmmc-practices.md`). Level 3 adds select NIST SP 800-172 enhanced requirements on top of the full 110.

## Level Determination Workflow

Determine the required CMMC level before doing anything else — every other workflow (gap assessment, SSP, POA&M, SPRS) depends on it.

| Step | Action | Output |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1. Check the contract | Look for DFARS 252.204-7019/7020/7021 in the clause list (Section I) and the required level in Section L/M or the Performance Work Statement | Level stated explicitly, or default to FCI-only |
| 2. Classify the data | Does the contractor receive/generate **FCI only**, or does it also receive/process/store/transmit **CUI**? | FCI-only → Level 1; CUI present → Level 2 minimum |
| 3. Check program criticality | For CUI programs, is this a "critical" national security program (nuclear, certain weapons systems, highest-priority DIB programs)? | Non-critical → Level 2 self-assessment eligible; critical → Level 2 C3PAO or Level 3 |
| 4. Confirm assessment track | Level 2: self-assessment (non-critical) vs. C3PAO third-party certification (critical); Level 3: DIBCAC-led, requires a current Level 2 C3PAO certification first | Assessment type and cadence |
| 5. Document the determination | Record the FCI/CUI rationale and level determination in the SSP scope section | Auditable justification |

**Decision table:**

| Data Handled | Program Type | CMMC Level | Assessment |
|--------------|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| FCI only | Any | Level 1 | Annual self-assessment |
| CUI | Non-critical | Level 2 | Self-assessment (110 practices), SPRS submission, annual affirmation |
| CUI | Critical | Level 2 | Triennial C3PAO assessment, SPRS submission |
| CUI, APT-priority program | Highest-priority DoD programs | Level 3 | DIBCAC-led assessment (requires current Level 2 C3PAO cert) |

**Rule of thumb**: if DFARS 252.204-7021 appears in the contract, the level is specified in the contract itself — check Section L or the PWS rather than inferring it. Consult `references/cmmc-levels.md` for the full DFARS clause mapping and `references/cmmc-practices.md` for the practice-to-level tagging.

## Core Workflows

### 1. Gap Assessment
When performing a gap assessment:
1. Confirm the CMMC level required by the contract (check DFARS clause — 7019 = Level 1, 7020 = Level 2 self, 7021 = Level 2/3 C3PAO)
2. Identify the CUI/FCI scope — which systems, networks, and personnel touch CUI
3. Assess all applicable practices against current controls
4. Produce a gap table: **Practice ID | Domain | Practice Statement | Status | Evidence Needed | Gap Notes**
5. Calculate estimated SPRS score impact from gaps
6. Prioritize remediation by risk and assessment timeline

**Status definitions:**
- ✅ MET — practice fully implemented with documented evidence
- 🟡 PARTIAL — partially implemented; evidence exists but gaps remain
- ❌ NOT MET — not implemented; will reduce SPRS score
- N/A — not applicable (document rationale in SSP)

### 2. System Security Plan (SSP)
When drafting or reviewing an SSP:
- SSP must cover all 110 practices (Level 2) or applicable Level 1 practices
- Each practice entry must include: **Practice ID | Requirement Statement | Implementation Description | Responsible Roles | Associated Systems | Evidence/Artifacts**
- Include system boundary definition, network diagrams reference, and data flows for CUI
- Mark non-applicable practices with documented justification
- **Describe only what IS implemented.** Where implementation is partial or pending (e.g., MFA not yet on legacy workstations), say so explicitly in the SSP entry and route the gap to a named POA&M item — an SSP that papers over gaps fails assessment and creates False Claims Act exposure
- Consult `references/cmmc-practices.md` for full practice text

### 3. SPRS Score Calculation
The Supplier Performance Risk System (SPRS) score uses the DoD Assessment Methodology for NIST SP 800-171:
- **Starting score**: 110 points (all practices implemented)
- **Score range**: +110 (all MET) to **−203** (all NOT MET)
- **Weighted deductions**: each NOT MET practice deducts its assigned weight — **5, 3, or 1 points** depending on the practice's security impact (highest-impact practices like AC.L2-3.1.3, IA.L2-3.5.3, SC.L2-3.13.8, SC.L2-3.13.11, and SI.L2-3.14.6 carry 5-point deductions)
- **Partial implementation = full deduction** — there is no partial credit; a practice is either MET or it loses the full point value
- **Submission**: required for all Level 2 contracts at sprs.csd.disa.mil
- **Basic Assessment**: the contractor's self-generated score based on a self-assessment against all 110 practices; this is what gets submitted and reviewed by DoD contracting officers
- **Affirmation requirement**: a senior company official must affirm the accuracy of the submitted score/assessment; annual affirmation is required even between full assessment cycles, and false affirmations carry False Claims Act exposure
- Consult `references/cmmc-assessment.md` for the full domain-level point-value table and highest-impact practice list

### 4. POA&M Management
A POA&M documents practices not yet met and the remediation roadmap to close them:
- Required for Level 2/3; each item: **Practice ID | Weakness Description | Remediation Steps | Milestones | Scheduled Completion | Resources | Status | Evidence of Closure**
- **POA&M-eligible practices**: at certification, only practices with a point value of **1** under the DoD scoring methodology may remain open in a POA&M (no 5-point items; 3-point items only in the narrow partial-credit cases the rule allows), and the assessment score must be at least **88** (0.8 × 110)
- **Critical practices — never POA&M-eligible at certification.** The following must be fully MET before any certification is issued: AC.L2-3.1.3 (CUI flow control), IA.L2-3.5.3 (MFA), SC.L2-3.13.8 (encryption in transit), SC.L2-3.13.11 (FIPS-validated cryptography), SI.L2-3.14.6 (attack monitoring), AU.L2-3.3.1 (audit logging), IR.L2-3.6.1 (incident response capability)
- **180-day closeout rule**: when conditional certification is granted with an approved POA&M, all remaining POA&M items must be remediated within **180 days** of the certification date; failure to remediate triggers certification revocation
- **Conditional vs. final certification**: conditional certification = non-critical practices open in POA&M, 180-day clock running; final certification = all 110 practices MET, valid for 3 years
- Level 3 (DIBCAC): **no POA&M at certification** — every practice, including SP 800-172 enhancements, must be MET
- **Worked example — "our C3PAO found 8 practices NOT MET":** conditional certification is possible only if BOTH conditions hold — the score is still ≥88 after deductions AND all 8 NOT MET practices carry 1-point values. Eight 1-point misses = score 102 → conditional certification with a 180-day clock. But if even one of the 8 is a 3- or 5-point practice (or on the critical list above), there is no conditional path — remediate and reassess. A lapsed 180-day closeout revokes the conditional certification, breaks the annual senior-official affirmation in SPRS, and ends contract eligibility until reassessment
- Update POA&M items monthly; stale entries raise assessor concerns. Document root cause, not just the symptom
- Consult `references/cmmc-assessment.md` for the full POA&M entry format and best practices

### 5. Scoping
CMMC scoping determines which assets fall under assessment and how deeply each asset category is examined. Categorize every asset before starting a gap assessment:

| Asset Category | Definition | Assessment Treatment |
|-----------------|-----------|----------------------|
| **CUI Assets** | Assets that store, process, or transmit CUI | Fully assessed against all applicable practices |
| **Security Protection Assets (SPA)** | Assets that provide security functions for the CUI environment (e.g., firewalls, SIEM, IdP) but don't handle CUI directly | Assessed for the security capability they provide |
| **Contractor Risk Managed Assets (CRMA)** | Assets that can, but are not intended to, handle CUI, and are managed under the contractor's risk-based security policy | Documented in SSP; assessed at a reduced level with policy-based justification |
| **Specialized Assets** | IoT, OT, government-furnished equipment (GFE), restricted information systems, and test equipment | Documented in SSP with compensating controls; not assessed the same as standard IT |
| **Out-of-Scope Assets** | Assets that cannot process, store, or transmit CUI and have no security-relevant connection to CUI assets | Excluded from assessment; document the rationale (e.g., network segmentation, physical isolation) |

**Scoping workflow:**
1. Identify all CUI categories received under the contract (reference the DoD CUI Registry)
2. Map CUI flows — where CUI enters, is processed, stored, and transmitted
3. Classify every asset into one of the five categories above
4. Define the CUI Asset Boundary — the enclave or network segment containing CUI Assets and their supporting SPAs
5. Document in the SSP why each Out-of-Scope and CRMA asset is excluded or reduced-scope
6. **Enclave strategy**: where feasible, isolate CUI into a dedicated, segmented enclave (separate VLAN/domain, dedicated endpoints) to shrink the assessment boundary and reduce the number of in-scope assets
7. Cloud services handling CUI must be **FedRAMP Authorized at Moderate or equivalent**

## Assessment Readiness

### System Security Plan (SSP) Structure
The SSP is the foundational artifact for both self-assessment and C3PAO/DIBCAC assessment. It must include:

| SSP Section | Content |
|-------------|---------|
| System identification | System name, owner, purpose, operational status |
| System boundary | Network diagrams, CUI Asset Boundary, asset category inventory (CUI/SPA/CRMA/Specialized/Out-of-Scope) |
| CUI data flows | Where CUI enters, is processed, stored, transmitted, and exits |
| Practice implementation | One entry per practice: **Practice ID \| Requirement Statement \| Implementation Description \| Responsible Roles \| Associated Systems \| Evidence/Artifacts** |
| Non-applicable practices | Documented justification for any N/A determination |
| POA&M reference | Link to current POA&M for any NOT MET practices |

### Evidence Per Assessment Objective
Each NIST SP 800-171 practice decomposes into one or more assessment objectives (per NIST SP 800-171A). For each objective, prepare:
- **Documentary evidence**: policies, procedures, plans (SSP, access control policy, incident response plan, training records) — must show author, date, version, and approval signature
- **Technical evidence**: configuration exports (firewalls, Active Directory, SIEM), vulnerability scan reports (authenticated scans preferred), MFA enrollment reports, patch management reports
- **Interview evidence**: assessors interview ISSO/ISSM, system administrators, end users, and executives — documentation alone cannot substitute for interviews

### C3PAO Assessment Phases (Level 2, Critical Programs)
1. **Documentation review (remote)** — C3PAO reviews SSP, network diagrams, policies, POA&M; requests the artifact list
2. **Assessment activities (on-site or remote)** — interviews, technical testing, process observation
3. **Findings and reporting** — C3PAO issues a Findings Report of MET / NOT MET / NOT APPLICABLE per practice; contractor may submit additional evidence in a limited response window
4. **Certification decision** — all 110 MET → full certification (3-year validity); limited non-critical practices open → conditional certification with 180-day POA&M closeout; critical practices unmet → no certification, remediate and reschedule

### Self-Assessment Paths (Level 1 and Level 2 Non-Critical)
| Step | Level 1 | Level 2 (Self-Assessment) |
|------|---------|---------------------------|
| 1 | Assess all 17 practices against FAR 52.204-21 | Assess all 110 practices against NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2 |
| 2 | Calculate SPRS score (max 17, 1 point per practice) | Calculate SPRS score using weighted deductions (110 to −203) |
| 3 | Submit to SPRS (sprs.csd.disa.mil) | Submit to SPRS |
| 4 | Senior official affirms accuracy | Senior official affirms accuracy |
| 5 | Repeat annually | Repeat annually; DoD reserves audit rights, false statements carry False Claims Act liability |

### Flow-Down to Subcontractors
DFARS 252.204-7021(c) requires prime contractors to include CMMC requirements in **all subcontracts at all tiers** where the subcontractor processes, stores, or transmits FCI or CUI: **FCI-only subcontractors need Level 1; CUI subcontractors need Level 2**. The prime must specify the required level in the subcontract and verify subcontractor status (SPRS / certification evidence) **before** flowing FCI/CUI or continuing performance. The clause family travels together: 7012 (safeguarding + 72-hour DIBNET incident reporting), 7019 (self-assessment currency), and 7020 (SPRS posting and assessment access) flow down alongside 7021.

**When a sub handling CUI turns out to be uncertified — remediation menu (advise all options):**
1. **Stop the CUI flow immediately** and document the containment step
2. **Rescope the sub to FCI-only** work (drops the requirement to Level 1) where the statement of work allows
3. **Sponsor an enclave** (prime-controlled environment the sub accesses, keeping CUI inside the prime's certified boundary)
4. **Replace the subcontractor** before the next option period
Whichever path: document interim risk acceptance, and warn that continuing to flow CUI to a knowingly non-compliant sub while affirming compliance creates **False Claims Act exposure** for the prime. Map CUI to each subcontractor and record levels in the supply chain security program.

## Common Pitfalls to Flag

- **Scope creep**: Including systems that don't touch CUI inflates assessment burden
- **Missing flow-down**: Prime contractors must flow CMMC requirements to subcontractors handling CUI
- **FIPS validation**: Encryption must use FIPS 140-2/3 validated modules — not just "AES-256"
- **MFA gaps**: IA.L2-3.5.3 requires MFA for all CUI access — the most commonly failed practice
- **Incident reporting**: DFARS 7012 requires reporting to DIBNET within **72 hours** of discovering a cyber incident
- **Cloud CUI**: Using non-FedRAMP cloud for CUI violates DFARS 7012 enclave requirements
