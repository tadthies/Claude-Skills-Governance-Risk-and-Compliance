# ISO 27001:2022 to NIS2 Art. 21 Cross-Reference

ISO/IEC 27001:2022 certification provides strong evidence of NIS2 compliance for many Art. 21 measures. However, ISO 27001 certification does NOT substitute NIS2 obligations — entities remain responsible for meeting Art. 21, Art. 20, and Art. 23 requirements directly.

Key gaps where NIS2 goes beyond ISO 27001:
- **Art. 21(2)(d)**: NIS2 explicitly mandates supply chain security obligations tied to ENISA coordinated risk assessments (Art. 22)
- **Art. 21(2)(j)**: NIS2 explicitly mandates MFA — ISO 27001 Annex A.8.5 covers authentication but MFA is not universally required
- **Art. 20**: Management body personal liability has no ISO 27001 equivalent
- **Art. 23**: Incident reporting timelines (24h/72h/1 month) are more prescriptive than ISO 27001's general incident management controls

## ISO 27001 Controls With No Direct NIS2 Measure Equivalent

The following ISO 27001:2022 Annex A controls are important for overall security posture but do not map to a specific Art. 21 measure. They may still be relevant for NIS2 governance and compliance evidence:

- **A.5.2** IS roles and responsibilities
- **A.5.31** Legal, statutory, regulatory, contractual requirements  
- **A.5.32** Intellectual property rights
- **A.5.33** Protection of records
- **A.5.34** Privacy and PII protection (→ see also GDPR)
- **A.6.4** Disciplinary process
- **A.8.1** User endpoint devices
- **A.8.9** Configuration management
- **A.8.10** Information deletion

## NIS2 Requirements With Limited ISO 27001 Coverage

| NIS2 Requirement | Gap vs ISO 27001 | Recommended Action |
|---|---|---|
| Art. 20 — Management body approval and personal liability | No ISO 27001 equivalent | Board cybersecurity policy; training records; documented approval minutes |
| Art. 23 — 24h early warning | ISO 27001 A.5.24–5.26 cover incident management but not specific timelines | Pre-drafted CSIRT notification templates; automated alerting workflows |
| Art. 23 — 72h notification | Same as above | Incident triage runbooks with timeline checkpoints |
| Art. 23 — 1-month final report | Same as above | Post-incident review template with all Art. 23(4) required fields |
| Art. 22 — ENISA supply chain risk assessments | ISO 27001 A.5.19–5.23 cover supplier security generally | Monitor ENISA and national authority supply chain advisories; integrate into supplier risk register |
| Art. 21(2)(j) — MFA mandate | ISO 27001 A.8.5 covers authentication; MFA not universal | Deploy MFA for remote access, privileged accounts, cloud consoles as minimum |

## Practical Guidance for ISO 27001-Certified Entities

If your organisation holds ISO 27001:2022 certification, you are well-positioned for NIS2 but should:

1. **Confirm entity classification** — verify whether you are an EE or IE under Art. 3 and your Member State's transposition law
2. **Address Art. 20 governance** — document board-level approval of cybersecurity measures and ensure training records are maintained
3. **Implement the Art. 23 reporting workflow** — your IRP likely needs an explicit NIS2 notification track with pre-drafted CSIRT templates and 24h/72h/1-month checkpoints
4. **Review supply chain coverage** — map your supplier security controls to Art. 21(2)(d) and integrate ENISA coordinated risk assessment outputs
5. **Mandate MFA** — if not already universal, deploy MFA for remote access and privileged accounts
6. **Register with your national competent authority** — most Member States require in-scope entities to self-register
