## CSF 2.0 Structure — The Six Functions

CSF 2.0 introduced a sixth function, **Govern (GV)**, placing organizational cybersecurity governance at the center of the framework.

| Function | ID | Purpose | Key Outputs |
|----------|----|---------|------------|
| **Govern** | GV | Establish and monitor the org's cybersecurity risk management strategy, expectations, and policy | Cybersecurity policy, roles/responsibilities, risk tolerance, supply chain risk strategy |
| **Identify** | ID | Understand cybersecurity risks to systems, assets, data, people, and capabilities | Asset inventory, risk assessment, improvement planning |
| **Protect** | PR | Implement safeguards to manage cybersecurity risks | Access controls, awareness training, data security, platform security, tech resilience |
| **Detect** | DE | Find and analyse cybersecurity events | Continuous monitoring, adverse event analysis |
| **Respond** | RS | Take action on detected cybersecurity incidents | Incident management, analysis, mitigation, reporting, communication |
| **Recover** | RC | Restore assets and operations after an incident | Incident recovery, communication |

Consult `references/csf-20-functions-categories.md` for the complete list of all categories and subcategories with IDs.

## Core Concepts

### Tiers (1–4)
Implementation Tiers describe the degree to which an organization's cybersecurity risk management practices exhibit the characteristics defined in the framework. They are **not maturity levels** — tier advancement should be driven by risk reduction needs, not a desire to reach Tier 4.

| Tier | Name | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| 1 | Partial | Ad hoc, reactive. Risk management practices are not formalised. |
| 2 | Risk-Informed | Risk management is approved by management but not org-wide policy. |
| 3 | Repeatable | Org-wide risk management policy is formally approved and consistently applied. |
| 4 | Adaptive | Risk management is continuously improved through lessons learned, threat intelligence, and predictive indicators. |

Tiers apply to three dimensions: **Risk Management Process**, **Integrated Risk Management Program**, and **External Participation**.

Consult `references/csf-implementation-tiers.md` for detailed tier descriptions and advancement guidance.

### Profiles
A **CSF Profile** describes the alignment between an organization's cybersecurity activities and outcomes, business requirements, risk tolerance, and resources.

- **Current Profile**: The cybersecurity outcomes currently achieved
- **Target Profile**: The desired cybersecurity outcomes to achieve based on business goals and risk appetite
- **Gap**: The delta between Current and Target — this drives the prioritised action plan

Profiles are typically expressed as a table of subcategories rated against their current and target states (e.g., Not Implemented / Partial / Largely Implemented / Fully Implemented).

## Core Workflows

### 1. Gap Assessment
When asked to perform or help with a gap assessment:
1. Ask for: CSF version, industry/sector, organisation size, any known Crown Jewels or high-risk areas
2. Produce a table covering all six functions, with categories and subcategories
3. For each subcategory: **Current State**, **Target State**, **Gap**, **Priority (High/Medium/Low)**
4. Summarise critical gaps by function and recommend a prioritised remediation order
5. Offer to generate an Implementation Roadmap

**Current State definitions:**
- ✅ Fully Implemented — control/practice is in place, documented, and operating effectively
- 🟡 Partially Implemented — some evidence exists, inconsistently applied, or gaps remain
- ❌ Not Implemented — no evidence of implementation
- N/A — not applicable to this organisation's context with documented rationale

### 2. Profile Creation
When asked to build an organisational profile:
1. Identify the business context: industry, mission, legal/regulatory obligations, and key assets
2. Define Risk Tolerance: risk appetite statements per function
3. Map regulatory/contractual requirements to relevant subcategories
4. Build Current Profile (assessed state) and Target Profile (desired state)
5. Highlight subcategories where regulatory or legal obligations create mandatory target states

**Profile table format:**

| Function | Category | Subcategory | Current | Target | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------------|---------|--------|-------|
| GV | Organizational Context (GV.OC) | GV.OC-01 | Partial | Full | Board risk appetite not formally documented |

### 3. Implementation Roadmap
When asked to build an implementation plan:
1. Input: completed gap assessment or Target Profile
2. Prioritise gaps using: Risk Reduction Value × Effort (Low/Medium/High)
3. Group actions into phases (typically 30/60/90-day quick wins + 6/12-month strategic)
4. For each action: Subcategory ID | Action | Owner | Effort | Risk Reduction | Timeline
5. Note interdependencies (e.g., GV.RM must precede ID.RA; ID.AM must precede PR.AA)

**Key sequencing logic:**
- **Phase 1 prerequisites**: GV.OC (context), GV.RM (risk strategy), ID.AM (asset inventory), ID.RA (risk assessment) — nothing else is meaningful without these
- **Phase 2**: PR controls (protection measures) based on Phase 1 risk priorities
- **Phase 3**: DE and RS controls — detection and response capabilities
- **Phase 4**: RC controls + continuous improvement loop back to GV

### 4. Cross-Framework Mapping
When asked to map CSF to other frameworks:
- Read `references/csf-20-functions-categories.md` for subcategory IDs
- Common mappings:

| CSF Subcategory Area | NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 | ISO 27001:2022 Annex A | CIS Controls v8 |
|---------------------|---------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| GV.OC (Org Context) | PM-1, PM-2, PM-8 | 4.1, 4.2 | CIS 17 |
| ID.AM (Asset Mgmt) | CM-8, PM-5 | A.5.9, A.5.10 | CIS 1, 2 |
| ID.RA (Risk Assess) | RA-3, RA-5 | 6.1.2 | CIS 18 |
| PR.AA (Access Control) | AC-1 to AC-25 | A.5.15–5.18 | CIS 5, 6 |
| PR.DS (Data Security) | SC-1 to SC-51 | A.5.33, A.8.24 | CIS 3 |
| PR.IR (Tech Resilience) | CP-6, CP-7, CP-9 | A.8.6, A.5.30 | CIS 11 |
| DE.CM (Monitoring) | SI-4, AU-2 | A.8.15, A.8.16 | CIS 8 |
| DE.AE (Event Analysis) | IR-4, SI-4 | A.5.25 | CIS 8 |
| RS.MA (Incident Mgmt) | IR-1 to IR-10 | A.5.24–5.28 | CIS 17 |
| RC.RP (Recovery Plan) | CP-1 to CP-13 | A.5.29, A.5.30 | CIS 11 |

### 5. Policy Generation
When generating policies or documents aligned to CSF:
- Always include: Purpose, Scope, Policy Statement, Roles & Responsibilities, Procedures, Review Cycle, Mapping to CSF Subcategory IDs
- Include a document control block: Version | Author | Approved By | Date | Next Review

**CSF-aligned policy types:**

| Policy | Primary CSF Function | Key Subcategories |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Cybersecurity Governance Policy | GV | GV.OC, GV.RM, GV.RR, GV.PO |
| Asset Management Policy | ID | ID.AM |
| Risk Assessment Policy | ID | ID.RA |
| Improvement Policy | ID | ID.IM |
| Access Control Policy | PR | PR.AA |
| Awareness & Training Policy | PR | PR.AT |
| Data Security Policy | PR | PR.DS |
| Platform Security Policy | PR | PR.PS |
| Technology Resilience Policy | PR | PR.IR |
| Continuous Monitoring Policy | DE | DE.CM |
| Incident Response Policy | RS | RS.MA, RS.AN, RS.MI, RS.CO |
| Recovery Policy | RC | RC.RP, RC.CO |

| Topic | CSF 1.1 | CSF 2.0 |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Functions | 5 (ID, PR, DE, RS, RC) | 6 (+ **GV: Govern**) |
| Govern function | Governance embedded in ID | Standalone GV function — 6 categories |
| Supply chain risk | Limited (ID.SC) | Expanded: GV.SC (6 subcategories) |
| Total subcategories | 108 | 106 |
| Profiles | Basic concept | Strengthened with Org Profile templates |
| Audience | Critical infrastructure focus | Explicitly all organisations, all sizes, all sectors |
| CSF Tiers | 4 tiers | 4 tiers (same structure, refined descriptions) |
| Informative References | Embedded in document | Moved to separate online Reference Tool |
| Quick Start Guides | None | Added for SMBs, enterprises, risk managers, government |

Consult `references/csf-10-to-20-mapping.md` for a detailed migration guide from CSF 1.1 to 2.0.

## Sector-Specific Guidance

Different sectors have developed **Community Profiles** built on CSF. When the user's industry is known, tailor guidance accordingly:

| Sector | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| Financial services | FFIEC CAT maps closely to CSF; highlight GV.RM and DE.CM |
| Healthcare | HIPAA Security Rule maps to PR and DE functions; HHS HPH Profile available |
| Energy / OT | ICS/SCADA environments: emphasise PR.IR (resilience) and DE.CM; reference NERC CIP |
| Federal government | Map to NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5; note FedRAMP control baseline alignment |
| Manufacturing | Emphasise OT/IT convergence, PR.PS (platform security), and supply chain (GV.SC) |
| SMB | Use NIST CSF 2.0 Small Business Quick Start Guide; focus on Tier 1→2 advancement |
