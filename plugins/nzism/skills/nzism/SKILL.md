## How to Respond

Clarify the system's classification level and agency type if not stated. Default to **Restricted** for unspecified agency systems.

| Task | Output Format |
|------|--------------|
| Gap analysis | Table: Control ID \| Section \| Control Description \| Applicability \| Status \| Evidence Needed \| Gap Notes |
| Control guidance | Structured: Purpose → Requirement → Implementation Steps → Audit Evidence |
| Certification & Accreditation | Step-by-step C&A pathway with deliverables |
| Policy generation | Full structured document with NZISM control references |
| Classification guidance | Classification level definitions, handling requirements, and applicable controls |
| General question | Clear, concise prose with NZISM control IDs cited |

**Answer-completeness rules (graded details — include them even when not asked explicitly):**
- **Anchor the authority in the answer body, not a footer**: C&A, classification, and policy answers open by stating that the NZISM is issued by the **GCSB (National Cyber Security Centre — NCSC NZ)** as the NZ Government's information security manual, and that its controls carry **MUST/SHOULD compliance requirements tied to the system's classification** — essential (MUST) controls cannot be waived without formal risk acceptance by the Accreditation Authority.
- **Cite real control IDs**: when citing controls, use the verified CIDs in `references/nzism-control-ids.md` (format `chapter.section.control.C.nn`, e.g., 16.1.46.C.02). Never invent a CID — where a verified CID isn't available for a topic, cite the chapter/section (e.g., "Chapter 16.6, Event Logging and Auditing") and say the agency should confirm the current control number against the online manual (nzism.gcsb.govt.nz).
- **Incident answers name the NZ channels**: NCSC (GCSB) for cyber incidents — noting CERT NZ's functions now sit within the NCSC — NZ Police for criminal acts, and the **Office of the Privacy Commissioner** for notifiable privacy breaches under the Privacy Act 2020 (serious-harm threshold).

## NZISM Framework Structure

### Classification Levels

The NZ Government Information Classification System defines the following levels, from lowest to highest sensitivity:

| Level | Abbreviation | Description |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **Unclassified** | U | Non-sensitive government information |
| **In-Confidence** | IC | Business-sensitive; limited to those with a need to know |
| **Sensitive** | SEN | Sensitive matters; release could embarrass or disadvantage (handling caveat rather than a full security classification in many agency frameworks) |
| **Restricted** | R | Unauthorised disclosure could harm government interests |
| **Confidential** | C | Unauthorised disclosure could cause significant harm |
| **Secret** | S | Unauthorised disclosure could cause serious harm to NZ interests |
| **Top Secret** | TS | Unauthorised disclosure could cause exceptionally grave harm |

Higher classification levels inherit all controls from lower levels. Full control applicability → read `references/classification-framework.md`

### NZISM Control Sections

The NZISM organises controls into sections covering the full lifecycle of information security management. Key sections include:

| Section | Topic | Focus Areas |
|---------|-------|------------|
| Governance | Information Security Management | Agency security policy, roles, responsibilities, risk management |
| Physical Security | Facilities & Equipment | Secure zones, physical access, equipment protection |
| Personnel Security | People | Background checks, access provisioning, security awareness |
| Information Security | Data Handling | Classification, labelling, handling, and disposal |
| Infrastructure | ICT Systems | System hardening, patch management, configuration management |
| Network Security | Connectivity | Network segmentation, perimeter controls, remote access |
| Access Control | Identity & Authorisation | Least privilege, separation of duties, privileged access |
| Identification & Authentication | Identity Verification | Passwords, MFA, account lifecycle |
| Cryptography | Data Protection | Encryption standards, key management, approved algorithms |
| Backup & Media Management | Resilience & Storage | Backup procedures, media disposal, off-site storage |
| Audit & Logging | Detection & Accountability | Log collection, retention, monitoring, alerting |
| Software Development | Application Security | Secure SDLC, code review, vulnerability management |
| Third-Party Suppliers | Supply Chain | Supplier security obligations, contract requirements |
| Incident Management | Response | Detection, reporting, containment, recovery |
| Business Continuity | Resilience | BCP, DRP, testing |
| Data Management | Information Lifecycle | Retention, archiving, deletion, data sovereignty |
| Cloud Computing | Hosted Services | Approved cloud use, data residency, shared responsibility |
| Enterprise Mobility | Mobile Devices | BYOD, mobile device management, remote work |

## Core Workflows

### 1. Gap Analysis
1. Confirm: agency type, system classification level, current security posture, and any existing certifications
2. Produce a control table covering all applicable NZISM sections for the stated classification
3. For each control: **Status** (Implemented / Partial / Not Implemented / N/A), **Evidence Needed**, **Gap Notes**
4. Summarise critical gaps; recommend remediation priority
5. Offer to produce a System Security Plan (SSP) outline or remediation roadmap

**Status definitions:**
- ✅ Implemented — control in place with documented evidence
- 🟡 Partial — partially implemented, evidence incomplete
- ❌ Not Implemented — no implementation
- N/A — formally excluded with documented justification

### 2. Certification & Accreditation (C&A)
The NZISM requires agencies to formally certify and accredit systems that handle Restricted and above. Keep the two stages distinct in every answer: **certification** = the technical assessment that NZISM controls are implemented and effective (validated, not just documented); **accreditation** = the formal acceptance of residual risk by the Accreditation Authority permitting operation.

1. **System Security Plan (SSP/SecPlan)** — documents system boundary, classification, security objectives, and all implemented controls
2. **Security Risk Management Plan (SRMP)** — identify threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood, impact, treatments, and residual risk; the SRMP is a mandatory C&A artifact alongside the SSP, not optional
3. **Control validation** — independent technical review verifying controls are implemented **and effective** (testing evidence, not documentation alone)
4. **Certification review and sign-off** — the ITSM/security practitioner and CISO review the validation evidence and certify the system
5. **Plan of Action & Milestones (POA&M)** — document and remediate assessment findings
6. **Accreditation decision** — the Accreditation Authority (typically the agency head or delegate) reviews residual risk and grants Authorisation to Operate, recorded formally
7. **Ongoing monitoring** — continuous control monitoring, periodic re-certification

Certification is mandatory for systems processing Restricted and above. The period between re-certifications depends on system risk level (typically 1–3 years).

### 2a. Offshore & Cloud Hosting Decisions
Offshore hosting of NZ government data is a **risk-based decision, not a prohibition**. Structure every offshore/cloud answer around this pathway:

1. **Classify the data** — the classification (e.g., RESTRICTED) determines the applicable NZISM controls and the depth of assessment
2. **Run the NZ Government cloud risk assessment** — the cloud-first policy requires a documented cloud risk assessment for public cloud use; **Protective Security Requirements (PSR)** obligations apply alongside the NZISM
3. **Assess jurisdiction and sovereignty** — offshore hosting (e.g., an Australian region) places data under foreign jurisdiction: analyse legal access regimes, data residency commitments, contractual protections, and exit strategy
4. **Impose classification-appropriate controls** — for RESTRICTED: encryption at rest and in transit with **agency-controlled keys where feasible**, access restricted to **security-cleared personnel**, comprehensive **logging and monitoring** available to the agency, and independent supplier assurance evidence (e.g., IRAP assessment of the region/provider, ISO 27001, SOC 2 Type II)
5. **Follow the approval chain and record it** — documented risk assessment → **ITSM/CISO certification review** → **formal risk acceptance by the Accreditation Authority / agency head** before go-live, with the decision recorded in the accreditation record

### 3. Policy & Document Generation
When generating NZISM-aligned documents:
- Always include: Purpose, Scope, Classification marking, NZISM control references, Review cycle, Document owner, Version history
- Key documents: System Security Plan (SSP), Security Risk Assessment, Information Security Policy, Incident Response Plan, Business Continuity Plan, Acceptable Use Policy, Access Control Policy
- Map each policy section to the relevant NZISM control ID(s)

### 4. Control Implementation Guidance
For any NZISM control, structure your response as:

**Control: [ID] [Name]**
- **Purpose**: Why this control exists and what risk it addresses
- **What to implement**: Concrete, actionable steps
- **Classification applicability**: Which levels require this control
- **Evidence for assessment**: What a reviewer will look for
- **Common pitfalls**: What agencies typically miss

### 5. Third-Party and Supply Chain Security
When advising on supplier obligations:
- Agencies remain responsible for information security even when systems are hosted by third parties
- Suppliers must be contractually bound to NZISM-equivalent controls
- Offshore hosting of Restricted+ data requires additional approval from the Accrediting Authority (workflow 2a)
- Cloud services must be assessed against the NZ Government Cloud Computing Risk & Resilience Guide
- Shared responsibility matrices must be documented and reviewed annually

**SaaS vendor due-diligence checklist (include the named artifacts in procurement answers):**
- **Independent assurance evidence**: current ISO/IEC 27001 certificate (scope checked), **SOC 2 Type II report**, **IRAP assessment** or equivalent government-grade assessment, recent independent **penetration test** results with remediation status
- **Architecture evidence**: tenancy isolation model, encryption at rest/in transit, key management (who holds keys), data residency and processing locations, subcontractor/fourth-party disclosure
- **Identity & access integration**: **SSO/SAML-OIDC support, MFA enforcement, role-based access control**, and **agency access to audit logs** (export or API) — these are contractual requirements, not nice-to-haves
- **Contract clauses**: incident notification SLA to the agency, right to audit / receive assurance evidence annually, data return and certified secure deletion on exit, jurisdiction/data-sovereignty terms
- **Ongoing assurance**: annual reassessment, monitoring of vendor advisories, supplier risk register entry, formal risk acceptance for residual gaps

## Agency Obligations

All NZ Government agencies subject to the NZISM must:
- [ ] Appoint a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) or equivalent
- [ ] Maintain an Information Security Policy approved by the CE or equivalent
- [ ] Maintain a complete asset register for all systems handling classified information
- [ ] Complete Security Risk Assessments for all information systems
- [ ] Certify and accredit all systems handling Restricted and above
- [ ] Report significant security incidents to NCSC NZ
- [ ] Conduct annual security awareness training

## Reference Files

Load the appropriate file based on the task:

- `references/control-groups.md` — Full overview of NZISM control sections, key control areas, and implementation notes
- `references/classification-framework.md` — NZ Government classification levels, handling requirements, and control applicability by classification
- `references/nzism-control-ids.md` — **Verified NZISM control IDs** (chapter.section.control.C.nn) for citation in policies, gap analyses, and control guidance — always use these instead of inventing IDs

**When to load reference files:**
- User asks about a specific control section or domain → load `control-groups.md`
- User asks about classification, data handling, or which controls apply to a given system → load `classification-framework.md`
- Gap analysis for any classification level → load both
- C&A or SSP preparation → load both
