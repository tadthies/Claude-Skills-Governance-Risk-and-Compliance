## NZISM Framework Structure

### Classification Levels

The NZ Government Information Classification System defines the following levels, from lowest to highest sensitivity:

| Level | Abbreviation | Description |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **Unclassified** | U | Non-sensitive government information |
| **In-Confidence** | IC | Business-sensitive; limited to those with a need to know |
| **Sensitive** | SEN | Sensitive matters; release could embarrass or disadvantage (handling caveat rather than a full security classification in many agency frameworks) |
| **Restricted** | R | Unauthorised disclosure could harm government interests |
| **Confidential** | C | Unauthorised disclosure could cause significant harm |
| **Secret** | S | Unauthorised disclosure could cause serious harm to NZ interests |
| **Top Secret** | TS | Unauthorised disclosure could cause exceptionally grave harm |

Higher classification levels inherit all controls from lower levels. Full control applicability → read `references/classification-framework.md`

### NZISM Control Sections

The NZISM organises controls into sections covering the full lifecycle of information security management. Key sections include:

| Section | Topic | Focus Areas |
|---------|-------|------------|
| Governance | Information Security Management | Agency security policy, roles, responsibilities, risk management |
| Physical Security | Facilities & Equipment | Secure zones, physical access, equipment protection |
| Personnel Security | People | Background checks, access provisioning, security awareness |
| Information Security | Data Handling | Classification, labelling, handling, and disposal |
| Infrastructure | ICT Systems | System hardening, patch management, configuration management |
| Network Security | Connectivity | Network segmentation, perimeter controls, remote access |
| Access Control | Identity & Authorisation | Least privilege, separation of duties, privileged access |
| Identification & Authentication | Identity Verification | Passwords, MFA, account lifecycle |
| Cryptography | Data Protection | Encryption standards, key management, approved algorithms |
| Backup & Media Management | Resilience & Storage | Backup procedures, media disposal, off-site storage |
| Audit & Logging | Detection & Accountability | Log collection, retention, monitoring, alerting |
| Software Development | Application Security | Secure SDLC, code review, vulnerability management |
| Third-Party Suppliers | Supply Chain | Supplier security obligations, contract requirements |
| Incident Management | Response | Detection, reporting, containment, recovery |
| Business Continuity | Resilience | BCP, DRP, testing |
| Data Management | Information Lifecycle | Retention, archiving, deletion, data sovereignty |
| Cloud Computing | Hosted Services | Approved cloud use, data residency, shared responsibility |
| Enterprise Mobility | Mobile Devices | BYOD, mobile device management, remote work |

## Core Workflows

### 1. Gap Analysis
1. Confirm: agency type, system classification level, current security posture, and any existing certifications
2. Produce a control table covering all applicable NZISM sections for the stated classification
3. For each control: **Status** (Implemented / Partial / Not Implemented / N/A), **Evidence Needed**, **Gap Notes**
4. Summarise critical gaps; recommend remediation priority
5. Offer to produce a System Security Plan (SSP) outline or remediation roadmap

**Status definitions:**
- ✅ Implemented — control in place with documented evidence
- 🟡 Partial — partially implemented, evidence incomplete
- ❌ Not Implemented — no implementation
- N/A — formally excluded with documented justification

### 2. Certification & Accreditation (C&A)
The NZISM requires agencies to formally certify and accredit systems that handle Restricted and above:

1. **System Security Plan (SSP)** — documents system boundary, classification, security objectives, and all implemented controls
2. **Security Risk Assessment** — identify threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood, impact, and residual risk
3. **Security Assessment** — independent technical review of implemented controls
4. **Plan of Action & Milestones (POA&M)** — document and remediate assessment findings
5. **Accreditation Decision** — Accrediting Authority reviews residual risk and grants Authorisation to Operate (ATO)
6. **Ongoing monitoring** — continuous control monitoring, periodic re-certification

Certification is mandatory for systems processing Restricted and above. The period between re-certifications depends on system risk level (typically 1–3 years).

### 3. Policy & Document Generation
When generating NZISM-aligned documents:
- Always include: Purpose, Scope, Classification marking, NZISM control references, Review cycle, Document owner, Version history
- Key documents: System Security Plan (SSP), Security Risk Assessment, Information Security Policy, Incident Response Plan, Business Continuity Plan, Acceptable Use Policy, Access Control Policy
- Map each policy section to the relevant NZISM control ID(s)

### 4. Control Implementation Guidance
For any NZISM control, structure your response as:

**Control: [ID] [Name]**
- **Purpose**: Why this control exists and what risk it addresses
- **What to implement**: Concrete, actionable steps
- **Classification applicability**: Which levels require this control
- **Evidence for assessment**: What a reviewer will look for
- **Common pitfalls**: What agencies typically miss

### 5. Third-Party and Supply Chain Security
When advising on supplier obligations:
- Agencies remain responsible for information security even when systems are hosted by third parties
- Suppliers must be contractually bound to NZISM-equivalent controls
- Offshore hosting of Restricted+ data requires additional approval from the Accrediting Authority
- Cloud services must be assessed against the NZ Government Cloud Computing Risk & Resilience Guide
- Shared responsibility matrices must be documented and reviewed annually

## Key Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| GCSB | Government Communications Security Bureau — the NZ signals intelligence and cybersecurity agency |
| NCSC NZ | National Cyber Security Centre — GCSB's operational cybersecurity arm; maintains the NZISM |
| NZISM | New Zealand Information Security Manual — mandatory security framework for NZ government |
| SSP | System Security Plan — primary C&A artefact documenting system controls |
| ATO | Authorisation to Operate — formal sign-off by Accrediting Authority |
| C&A | Certification and Accreditation — NZISM's formal system approval process |
| ISCS | Information Security Classification System — NZ government classification scheme |
| POA&M | Plan of Action & Milestones — remediation plan for identified gaps |
| Accrediting Authority | Senior official responsible for accepting residual risk and granting ATO |
| Need-to-know | Principle that access is granted only when required for a legitimate business purpose |

## Agency Obligations

All NZ Government agencies subject to the NZISM must:
- [ ] Appoint a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) or equivalent
- [ ] Maintain an Information Security Policy approved by the CE or equivalent
- [ ] Maintain a complete asset register for all systems handling classified information
- [ ] Complete Security Risk Assessments for all information systems
- [ ] Certify and accredit all systems handling Restricted and above
- [ ] Report significant security incidents to NCSC NZ
- [ ] Conduct annual security awareness training
- [ ] Review and update security policies at least annually

---

## Reference Files

Load the appropriate file based on the task:

- `references/control-groups.md` — Full overview of NZISM control sections, key control areas, and implementation notes
- `references/classification-framework.md` — NZ Government classification levels, handling requirements, and control applicability by classification

**When to load reference files:**
- User asks about a specific control section or domain → load `control-groups.md`
- User asks about classification, data handling, or which controls apply to a given system → load `classification-framework.md`
- Gap analysis for any classification level → load both
- C&A or SSP preparation → load both
