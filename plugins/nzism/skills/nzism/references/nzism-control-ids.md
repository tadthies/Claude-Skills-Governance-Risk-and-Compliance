# NZISM — Verified Control IDs

Verified control identifiers for citation in answers. Format: `chapter.section.control.C.nn`. Source: official NZISM (nzism.gcsb.govt.nz) chapter structure as mapped in the AWS Config NZISM 3.8 conformance pack (control names cross-checked against the manual's section titles). **Cite only IDs from this list; for topics not covered here, cite the chapter/section and direct the agency to confirm the current control number in the online manual** — the NZISM is updated roughly twice a year (v3.9 renamed Chapter 16 to "Authentication and Access Controls" and added new controls, e.g., 16.1.25.C.01, 16.1.27.C.02, 16.1.31.C.01–03 for passwordless and phishing-resistant MFA).
