- Responding to personal data breaches with a 72-hour notification workflow
- Sector-specific guidance for finance, AI, cloud computing, blockchain, and big data
- Evaluating Data Protection Officer (DPO) appointment requirements and qualifications
- Interpreting SME exemptions and transitional provisions
