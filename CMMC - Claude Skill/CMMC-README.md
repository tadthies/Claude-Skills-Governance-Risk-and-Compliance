# CMMC 2.0 Skill for Claude

> **Disclaimer:** This skill provides informational guidance on CMMC 2.0 requirements based on 32 CFR Part 170, NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2, and associated DFARS clauses. It does not constitute legal advice and does not substitute for engagement with a Registered Practitioner Organization (RPO) or Certified Third-Party Assessment Organization (C3PAO). CMMC certification decisions, SPRS score submissions, and DIBCAC assessment responses involve significant legal and contractual obligations — consult a qualified CMMC professional for high-stakes compliance matters.

## 1. What Does the Skill Do?

This skill turns Claude into an expert **CMMC 2.0 Registered Practitioner and NIST SP 800-171 implementation advisor**, providing deep, structured guidance to defense contractors, subcontractors, and their IT and compliance teams across the full CMMC 2.0 compliance lifecycle. It covers the final CMMC 2.0 rule (**32 CFR Part 170**, effective December 2024) and all supporting regulatory instruments: **NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2**, **NIST SP 800-172**, and **DFARS clauses 252.204-7012/7019/7020/7021**.

The skill handles CMMC's three-level framework with precision, distinguishing between the 17 practices required for **Level 1** (FCI protection, FAR 52.204-21 self-assessment), the 110 practices required for **Level 2** (CUI protection, NIST SP 800-171, triennial C3PAO assessment or self-assessment for non-critical programs), and the enhanced requirements of **Level 3** (APT resistance, NIST SP 800-172 practices, DIBCAC government assessment). Advice is always scoped to the applicable level and the specific DFARS clause in the contract.

A central capability is the **SPRS score calculation** — the skill walks through the Supplier Performance Risk System scoring methodology, starting from 110 and applying per-practice deductions for each NOT MET practice, to produce an estimated score with remediation priorities. It also supports **System Security Plan (SSP) drafting**, generating fully structured SSP sections with practice ID, requirement statement, implementation description, responsible roles, associated systems, and evidence artifacts — exactly the format expected by C3PAOs and DIBCAC assessors.

The skill is also attentive to the most common compliance pitfalls in the Defense Industrial Base: scope creep that inflates assessment burden, missing CUI flow-down to subcontractors, non-FIPS-validated encryption, MFA gaps (the most commonly failed practice — IA.L2-3.5.3), DIBNET incident reporting timelines, and the use of non-FedRAMP cloud services for CUI. It surfaces these issues proactively in every assessment.

## 3. Common Use Cases

### Level Determination and Contract Scoping
- *"We just received a new DoD RFP. Which CMMC level does DFARS 252.204-7021 require us to meet?"*
- *"What's the difference between a self-assessment under DFARS 7019 vs. a C3PAO assessment under DFARS 7021?"*
- *"We handle both FCI and CUI. Do we need Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3?"*
- *"Our prime contractor is flowing CMMC Level 2 down to us. What does that require?"*

### Gap Assessment
- *"Run a CMMC 2.0 Level 2 gap assessment. We have Active Directory, MFA on email only, no formal SSP, and we store CUI on shared drives."*
- *"Assess our Access Control (AC) domain practices against Level 2 requirements."*
- *"Which of the 110 practices are we most likely to fail if we're assessed today?"*
- *"What practices do IG1-covered organizations most commonly miss when they start preparing for CMMC?"*

### SSP Drafting
- *"Draft the SSP entry for AC.L2-3.1.3 — Control CUI flow to external systems."*
- *"Write the system boundary description section of our SSP for our AWS-hosted CUI environment."*
- *"Generate SSP entries for all Identification and Authentication (IA) domain practices."*
- *"Review our SSP entry for IA.L2-3.5.3 (MFA) — does it meet the documentation standard?"*

### SPRS Score Calculation
- *"Calculate our estimated SPRS score. We have 15 practices NOT MET and 8 PARTIAL."*
- *"Which NOT MET practices carry the highest point deductions? Where should we focus remediation first?"*
- *"Our current SPRS score is -47. What's a realistic remediation path to reach +80 in 6 months?"*

### POA&M Management
- *"Create a POA&M for our 12 NOT MET Level 2 practices, with milestones and owners."*
- *"Which POA&M items require accelerated timelines under CMMC 2.0 rules?"*
- *"Can we get conditional certification with open POA&M items? Which practices are eligible?"*

### CUI Scoping and Third-Party Cloud
- *"How do we define the CUI Asset Boundary? What's in scope vs. out of scope?"*
- *"We use Microsoft 365 Government (GCC High) for CUI. Does that satisfy DFARS 7012?"*
- *"Our cloud storage provider is FedRAMP Moderate authorized. Does that cover our CUI handling?"*
- *"We use Slack and Google Workspace. Can CUI flow through those systems?"*

### Example Prompts

```
"We're a 75-person defense subcontractor. We handle CUI under a DoD 
contract that includes DFARS 252.204-7021. We have never done a CMMC 
assessment. Walk me through the steps to determine our Level 2 readiness 
and produce a gap assessment table for all 17 CMMC domains."
```

```
"Calculate our estimated SPRS score. The following 110 practices have 
these statuses: [MET/PARTIAL/NOT MET list]. Identify the 10 highest-value 
remediation actions to maximize our SPRS score increase."
```

```
"Draft a complete SSP section for the following practices: AC.L2-3.1.1, 
AC.L2-3.1.2, AC.L2-3.1.3. Our environment is an on-premises Windows 
Server AD domain with 40 CUI-handling workstations."
```

```
"We use AWS GovCloud for CUI storage. Is this sufficient for DFARS 7012 
compliance? What specific AWS services and configurations are required?"
```

```
"Our prime contractor has told us they are flowing CMMC Level 2 down to 
us as a subcontractor handling CUI design documents. What does this mean 
for our timeline, assessment type, and contractual obligations? Draft the 
flow-down clauses we should expect in our subcontract."
